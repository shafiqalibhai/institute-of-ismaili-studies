<P>Dmitry Bondarev&#8217;s (MA, PhD, St. Petersburg State University, Russia) research interests cover African linguistics (Saharan languages with a focus on Kanuri/Kanembu), the history of writing in Arabic based scripts (Ajami) in Africa, and annotated Qur&#8217;anic manuscripts in West Africa. In 2003 he started analysing Old Kanembu &#8211; an archaic (and virtually unknown) variety of Kanuri as attested in Qur&#8217;an manuscripts. During his fieldwork trips to north-east Nigeria and south-east Niger in 2005-2010 he worked on Kanuri and Kanembu dialects including an offspring of Old Kanembu (Tarjumo) used by Islamic scholars for Qur&#8217;anic studies. As a lead researcher, he is involved in the Early Nigerian Qur&#8217;anic manuscripts project (SOAS/AHRC) and in a DFG/AHRC funded international project on Old Kanembu with colleagues at Asien-Afrika-Institut, University of Hamburg.

<P>Beth Buggenhagen is an Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Indiana University, Bloomington. She completed her PhD in Sociocultural Anthropology in 2003 at the University of Chicago. She has conducted fieldwork in Dakar and Tuba, Senegal, and in the North American cities of Chicago and New York City. Her current research interests include circulation and value, material and visual culture, and gender and Islam. She is the editor (with Anne-Maria Makhulu and Stephen Jackson) of <I>Hard Work, Hard Times: Global Volatility and African Subjectivities</I> (University of California Press, 2010). She is also the author of the forthcoming book, <I>Muslim Families in Global Senegal: Money Takes Care of Shame</I> (Indiana University Press, 2011), which analyzes how Senegalese Murid migrants have circulated cargo and currency through official and unofficial networks globally. <I>Muslim Families in Global Senegal</I> focuses on trade and the transmission of enduring social value though cloth and religious offerings. Highlighting women's participation in these networks and the financial strategies they rely on, Beth Buggenhagen reveals the connections between economic profits and ritual and social authority. These strategies are not responses to a dispersed community in crisis, but rather produce new roles, wealth, and worth for Senegalese women in all parts of the globe.</P>

<P><B><A name=abdel></A>Abdel Kader Haidara</B></P>
<P>Sheikh Abdel Kader Haidara is heir, director, and curator of the Mamma Haidara Memorial Library at Timbuktu, Mali, which is the largest of 22 private libraries in the City of Timbuktu, and out of the 120 in The Republic of Mali. He is one of Timbuktu&#8216;s leading manuscripts experts, and the son of a renowned local collector, Mamma Haidara. He was 17 when his father died and left the collection in his hands. He was enlisted to collect manuscripts for the newly established Ahmed Baba Institute for Documentation and Research in Timbuktu, the first concerted efforts to save Mali&#8216;s ancient manuscripts that opened in 1970. He was successful in collecting more than 20,000 manuscripts for the Institute. It was later that he was able to raise enough money to open the Mamma Haidara Memorial Library, through the help of Henry Louis Gates, Jr. of Harvard University, who visited Timbuktu in 1996. The Andrew Mellon Foundation and other international friends have enabled the library to construct a new permanent home for its collections, which opened to the public in 2000. Today the library holds over 10,000 ancient manuscripts and many printed books. This family library has been in the Haidara family since before the 16<SUP>th</SUP> century. Abdel Kader Haidara is the honored guest and keynote speaker for the workshop.</P>

<P><B><A name=joseph></A>Joseph Hill</B></P>
<P>After receiving his PhD in Anthropology from Yale University in 2007, Joseph Hill taught at Yale University, the University of Rochester, and the American University in Cairo. His ongoing, collaborative research project documents a transnational Sufi movement, the Tijaniyya Ibrahimiyya, in West Africa, looking at its urbanisation, globalisation, and integration into contrasting political and cultural contexts. His fieldwork has concentrated on Senegal and Mauritania, with additional research among West African Muslims in New York and Cairo. The leitmotif underlying his academic writing is the question of how multiple claims of truth and authority are accommodated and contested through discourses of &#8220;visible&#8221; and &#8220;hidden&#8221; truths. He has explored this theme in articles on language, gender, cosmopolitanism, sovereignty, and globalisation. Currently, he is writing a book on women who act as Sufi leaders where religious authority is strongly associated with men. He shows how women both utilise and undermine prevalent gender roles to support their leadership. Although women&#8217;s authority and influence are largely hidden due to the expectation that pious women must not seek visibility, women&#8217;s leadership decisively impacts the spread and governance of Sufi groups.</P>

<P><B><A name=zulfikar></A>Zulfikar Hirji</B></P>
<P>Zulfikar Hirji (DPhil, Oxford) is Associate Professor at York University in the Department of Social and Cultural Anthropology. As an anthropologist and social historian, he is interested in how human societies articulate, represent and perform understandings of self, community and other in contemporary and historical contexts. His research focuses on Muslim societies in a range of historical and contemporary contexts. He is particularly concerned with the diverse ways in which Muslims express and articulate issues of deep human concern as well as matters of daily life. He also interrogates knowledge produced about Muslims, by academics and others. His research interests have lead him to study a range of issues including the production and performance of identity, the role of cultural workers and social movements, the dynamics of family networks and inter-generational migration, the socio-legal formation of communal identity in colonial contexts, and form and context of urban violence in religiously plural societies. He has conducted archival research and ethnographic fieldwork in various parts of the world including East Africa, South Asia, the Arabian Peninsula, Europe and North America. He is co-author and co-editor (with F. Daftary) of the <I>Ismailis, An Illustrated History</I> (IB Tauris &amp; IIS, 2008), and editor of <I>Diversity and Pluralism in Muslim Contexts</I> (IB Tauris &amp; IIS, 2010). He is currently co-editor of the Routledge Indian Ocean Series. In 2011, he has been an academic consultant for the Textile Museum of Canada exhibition and program on <I>Magic Squares: The Patterned Imagination of Muslim Africa in Contemporary Culture</I>, and has completed his first film, &#8216;Pushpanjali: A sensory invocation&#8217;, which is part of an ethnographic research project on the life-world of Tehreema Mitha, a Pakistan born, USA based, dancer-choreographer. Other current research projects include a critical biography of Sheikh-Sir Mbarak al-Hinawy (1896-1959), the second <I>liwali</I> of the British coastal protectorate at Mombasa. </P>

A specialist in Islamic art, the urban histories of pre-modern Muslim societies, and the interface between art and law in Muslim contexts, she has held the posts of Dean and Research Fellow at the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, Research Fellow at Oxford University and Visiting Fellow at the Aga Khan Programme for Art and Architecture at Harvard University. Professor Kana&#8217;an has undertaken a number of academic research projects including a study of institutions of architectural patronage in Ottoman Palestine including the <I>waqf</I>, and the manner in which pre-modern Muslim societies created civic space. This research formed the basis of two articles published in the journals <EM>Levant</EM> (2001) and <EM>Muqarnas</EM> (2001). Her research has also taken her to Oman where she carried out a comprehensive survey of Oman&#8217;s historical mosques focussing on their socio-legal development and artistic influences. An important aspect of this survey concerning the uniquely decorated <EM>mihrabs</EM> of <EM>Ibadhi</EM> mosques is published in <EM>Islamic Art in Oman</EM> (2008). Most recently, her interest in the confluence between art and law in Muslim contexts has lead to the re-assessment of the relationship between artist and patron in medieval Muslim societies. Her first article on this topic, &#8220;The <I>de jure</I> &#8216;Artist&#8217; of the Bobrinski Bucket: production and patronage in pre-Mongol Khurasan and Transoxiana&#8221;, was published in <I>Islamic Law and Society</I> (2009), and the second will appear in <I>Ars Orientalis</I> in 2012. She is currently working with the Textile Museum of Canada on a talismanic shirt from West Africa.</P>
