For over twelve centuries the region has been home to a magnificent Islamic civilisation that has profoundly affected all aspects of South Asian culture and life. The achievements of this civilisation are legendary. The Taj Mahal, the monu&shy;mental mosques, palaces, forts, and pleasure gardens that dot the Subcontinent&#8217;s landscape, as well as exquisite miniature paintings and intricate marble lat&shy;tice-work, are just a few of its more notable products. The civilisation has also nurtured several of the world&#8217;s greatest rulers, artists, mystics and poets, many of whose writings have endured as literary masterpieces still recited today.</div><div> </div><div><P><B>Keywords </B></P>

<P><B></B></P>
<P>Turko-Persian culture was associated with various ruling dynasties and the<I> ashraf; </I>the aristocracy of for&shy;eign origin. Its sphere of influence extended also to the <I>intelligentsia</I> and the <I>literati</I>, some of them Hindu, who were directly or indirectly patronized by the courts and the nobility. Physically, this culture was largely con&shy;fined to the major cities and towns, the centres of po&shy;litical, economic, and religious dominion. At the same time, because the Persian language was primarily used, it was an international culture that influenced, at least until the eighteenth century, Central Asia, Afghanistan, Iran and even Turkey. Its cosmopolitan character meant that the <I>literati</I> in Indian cities such as Delhi, Lahore, Bijapur and Dacca spoke the same language, read the same books, enjoyed the same poems as those in Herat (Afghanistan), <A href="text_onlydc94.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D302%27%29%29">Bukhara</A> (Central Asia), Isfahan (Iran) and Istanbul (Turkey). It also meant that poets, artists, and scholars were free to move between courts within this great cultural nexus in search of new or bet&shy;ter patronage.</P>
<P>Persian was not only the language of intellectual and artistic life in Muslim South Asia but was also the offi&shy;cial language of government and administration. The significance of Persian extended far beyond its use as a medium of communication among the elite, however. Persian became such a prominent cultural component in medieval India that Persian vocabulary features prominently in all of the major North Indian languages. Furthermore, it so strongly influenced the literary forms, idioms, and scripts of several Indic languages such as Urdu, Sindhi, Pushtu, and Balochi, that a knowledge of Persian becomes critical to an apprecia&shy;tion of their literatures. This is particularly true of Urdu, whose poetry cannot be truly understood in all its nuances without a thorough knowledge of the Persian poetic tradition.</P>
<P>Over the course of several centuries, the total quan&shy;tity of Persian literature produced in South Asia greatly exceeded that in Iran proper. The corpus is so vast that we can here only provide a summary of its contents. Every major and minor genre of Persian literature flourished here: from mystical poetry and biographies of saints to treatises on medicine, music, war and works of <I>belles </I><I>lettres</I>. Of special significance are the many historical works in Persian chronicling the reigns of almost every dynasty and ruler. These records have become important sources for reconstructing the his&shy;tory of Muslim India. Several important works of Indian literature in Sanskrit such as the <I>Mahabharata </I>and the <I>Atharvaveda </I>were also translated into Persian, often under royal patronage. The Emperor Akbar (died 1605 CE) for example, ordered the learned scholar Abdulgadir Badauni (died circa 1615 CE) to translate the Hindu epic <I>Ramayana</I>. Akbar&#8217;s great-grandson, the Prince Dara Shikoh (died 1659 CE), was himself responsi&shy;ble for translating the <I>Upanishads </I>into<I> </I>Persian under the title <I>Sirr-i Akbar </I>(<I>The Greatest Secret</I>).<I> </I>It<B><I> </I></B>is<I> </I>through a Latin translation of this work that nineteenth century European circles first became aware of the Hindu philosophical texts.</P>
<P>Poetry was by far the pre-dominant and most popu&shy;lar form of literary composition in Persian. Poets in me&shy;dieval India utilised all the major Persian forms, including the <I><A href="text_only5f7a.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D133%27%29%29">qasida</A></I>, a panegyric extolling the virtues of a ruler or patron, the <I>ghazal</I>, a mystically-tinged love lyric, and the <I><A href="text_only62c5.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D177%27%29%29">mathnawi</A></I>,<I> </I>a &#8220;double-rhymed&#8221; epic form used particularly for romances. In the religious sphere, the <I>madh</I> and <I>na&#8216;t</I> were employed in praise of Allah and the Prophet Muhammad, while the <I>marthiya </I>or elegies mourned the martyrs of Shi&#8216;a Islam, particularly the tragic massacre of <A href="text_only7eca.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D228%27%29%29">Imam</A> <A href="text_onlyb17b.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D239%27%29%29">Husayn</A> and his family at Karbala&#8217; in 680 CE. In addition to these verse forms, poets adhered strictly to poetic conventions regarding sym&shy;bols and imagery as developed in Iranian and Central Asian traditions. The vast majority of them delighted in composing <I>nazira</I>s, poems imitating the classical mod&shy;els of renowned Persian authors, as well as those of their peers, as a way of demonstrating their literary prowess. Not surprisingly, as they hardly ever drew themes and subjects from the Indic literary traditions, the vast corpus of Persian poetry composed in the sub&shy;continent consequently has very little that is distinc&shy;tively Indian in character. </P>
<P>The rare exception, in this regard, was Amir Khusrau (died 1325 CE), the so-called &#8220;Parrot of India,&#8221; the greatest Persian poet medieval Muslim India produced. Unlike his fellow-poets, he ventured into the territory of the local milieu, forbidden by convention, to search for new ideas. He was the first and only of the Persian poets who alluded to Indian customs in his lyrics, incorporating a number of Indian stories into his Persian epic romances and attempting to compose verse in a lo&shy;cal language, <I>Hindawi</I>. Interestingly, he introduces his Persian <I>divan</I> or collection of poems with a typically Indian idea inspired by indigenous poetry, associating the rainy season with separated lovers:</P>

<TD ></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR>Though Persian was the primary language of Turko-&shy;Persian culture, literatures in Arabic and Turkish were also cultivated. Despite the long-standing connections between Arabia and South Asia, Arabic language litera&shy;ture did not develop to the same extent as did Persian. Arabic was employed in a limited capacity, primarily for writing works on religious subjects and matters of Islamic jurisprudence. A significant portion of this reli&shy;gious literature consisted of collections and commen&shy;taries on the <I><A href="text_only9d79.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D258%27%29%29">hadith</A></I>,<I> </I>the corpus of accounts that recorded the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad. The study of <I>hadith </I>was so<I> </I>highly devel&shy;oped that medieval India could boast of several renowned and acclaimed scholars of this important re&shy;ligious genre, many of whom had travelled extensively in the Arab world. Many commentaries and super-commentaries on the Qur&#8217;an were also written. The Muslim rulers of kingdoms of the Deccan as well as Gujarat, perhaps to counter the Persian cultural ethos so domi&shy;nant in the north, also patronised Arabic literature of a more secular type by attracting to their courts promi&shy;nent Arabic scholars and poets from Hadramawt and Yemen. Finally we must note that the Arabic language was also employed (as it still is today) as the medium of instruction among the elite who wished to preserve their cultural identity in an environment in which they were a minority. In the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, with the collapse of the last major Mughal dynasty, the &#8220;literary tyranny of Arabic and Persian&#8221; as Richard Eaton states, was overthrown.</P>
<P>The Turko-Persian ethos, however, continued to re&shy;main strong and exert an influence on the vernacular literatures in a variety of ways. When, for example, the <I>literati</I> in the eighteenth century began to express themselves in an indigenous language, they called it by a Turkish name, Urdu, meaning &#8220;military camp,&#8221; pre&shy;sumably because the language originated as a means of communication between Turkish soldiers and the local population. They heavily persianised its vocabulary, incorporating literary forms from classical Persian. The symbols they employed in Urdu poetry were intimately connected with those from the Persian tradition. The most renowned writer of Urdu prose and poetry, Mirza [Asadullah Khan] Ghalib (died 1869), considered his Urdu poetry, persianised as it was, to be inferior to his Persian works.</P>

<DIV>Pioneering the use of Indian languages for Muslim literatures were various <A href="text_only21c0.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D89%27%29%29">Sufis</A> or mystics. By virtue of their esoteric interpretation of Islam and their focus on a personal relationship between the human and the di&shy;vine, they were suited in temperament to assimilating Islamic concepts and ideas to the Indian environment. While it may be too simplistic to conceive of them as missionaries who converted substantial populations to Islam, the overwhelming evidence suggests that the Sufis, and not the tradition-bound theologians and reli&shy;gious-lawyers, were initially responsible for popularis&shy;ing Islamic ideas among the masses. Literature composed by Sufis in local languages played an instru&shy;mental role in this process of the Indian acculturation to Islam.</DIV>
<P>The most significant characteristic of this literature was that it was folk in character, intended for the illit&shy;erate classes of society who lived mostly in the rural ar&shy;eas. This audience understood neither Arabic nor Persian, the languages of religion, theology, and secular learning in literate circles. Consequently, in order to overcome the language barrier, some Sufis began com&shy;posing religious poems in Indian vernaculars. These poems they then incorporated in popular Sufi rituals such as the <I>sama </I>(listening and dancing to mystical music). Of course, by choosing to write in the vernacu&shy;lars, the Sufis encountered the deep-seated prejudice among the Muslim elite towards the use of local Indian languages. As a consequence, they would sometimes have to preface their compositions with an apology or pleas to readers to look beyond the medium to the meaning. In this regard, many Sufis would agree with the sixteenth century religious leader, <A href="text_only03db.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D143%27%29%29">Pir</A>-i Raushan, who declared:<BR><BR></P>

<P>By the late seventeenth century, when Muslim literatures in vernacular languages from Punjab to Bengal at&shy;tained maturity, an overwhelming number of poets and writers were Sufi or affiliated with Sufi orders. Annemarie Schimmel suggests that the pioneering role of the Sufis in the development of Indic languages is analogous to that played by the mystics, monks and nuns of medieval Europe in the growth of modern European languages.</P>
<P>Much more was involved in the use of Indic lan&shy;guages for Muslim literatures than simply a new medium of communication. Islamic religious concepts needed to be expressed in terms that would be familiar and sensible to South Asian audiences from a variety of backgrounds. Sometimes this meant explaining an Islamic idea within a religious framework indigenous to the South Asian context, resulting in the blurring of religious boundaries that religious conservatives found objectionable. For example, in the folkloric <I>punthi </I>lit&shy;erature in the Bengali language, the Islamic concept of <I>nabi</I>/<I><A href="text_onlybe82.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D123%27%29%29">rasul</A></I>,<I> </I>a prophet/messenger sent by God to guide humanity, is identified with the Indian idea of <I>avatara</I>, a divine descent into the world to vanquish evil and maintain the good. Consequently, many works from this genre portrayed Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, as the last and most powerful of a long series of prophet-<I>avataras</I> that included Hindu deities such as Rama and Krishna. Other works, motivated by the de&shy;sire to elevate Islam over local religious traditions, de&shy;picted the triumph of the Prophet Muhammad and other legendary Muslim heroes over the gods and demons of the Hindu pantheon, creating, in effect, an alternative Muslim mythology for South Asian converts to Islam. There was also a similar juxtaposing of con&shy;cepts from the yogic and tantric traditions with Muslim mystical ones in many Sufi poems in Indic languages.</P>
<P>Muslim poets and writers of the vernacular tradition also freely adopted the literary structures and forms prevalent in the indigenous folk-poetic tradition, a tra&shy;dition that was predominantly oral in character, meant to be sung or recited often with musical accompani&shy;ment. This tradition was maintained and preserved by women, who were the most important custodians of folksongs, proverbs and folk customs. Thus, in addition to employing various indigenous verse forms, Sufi poetry adopted extensively the forms and symbols of songs sung by women as they performed their daily household chores. Within these songs they incorpo&shy;rated basic teachings about Islam. As an example, we cite the <I>chakki-narna</I>, a song<I> </I>recited by women in cer&shy;tain regions of Southern India while grinding grain at the <I>chakki, </I>the grindstone. Drawing parallels between various parts of the grindstone, the poet explains in a simple way the fundamental precepts of Islam:</P>

In those regions of South Asia, such as Punjab, <A href="text_only0c61.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D92%27%29%29">Sind</A> and the Deccan, where the cultivation and pro&shy;cessing of cotton was a major source of livelihood, po&shy;etry is replete with references to <I>dhikr, </I>for the spinning of cotton could be easily compared to the humming sound produced by constant <I>dhikr</I>.<I> </I>Shah Abdul Latif (died 1752 CE), the great poet of Sind, stretches even fur&shy;ther the parallel between the woman at the spinning<I> </I>wheel and the soul occupied in recollection of God.

<P>Perhaps the most interesting Indian literary conven&shy;tion that the Sufis incorporated into their poetry is rep&shy;resenting the soul as the <I>virahini</I>,<I> </I>a woman, usually a bride or bride-to-be, who longingly awaits her groom, symbolically representing God. Though the woman-soul symbolism is quite rare in Arabic and Persian po&shy;etic traditions, it is quite common in Indian literature. Its most renowned use is in Hindu devotional poetry addressed to the Hindu deity Krishna. The <I>gopis </I>(milk&shy;maids), in particular Radha, express their longing for union with their elusive beloved. Muslim poets adapted this symbol to an Islamic framework, varying the iden&shy;tity of the Muslim <I>virahin</I>&#8217;s beloved according to the context.</P>
<P><I></I></P>
<P>In many<I> qawwali</I>s,<I> </I>the popular songs typically sung at the shrines of many Sufi saints in South Asia, the bride-soul expresses her longing to offer herself up in utter devotion to her groom, who is either Allah or the Sufi master. We are reminded here of the popular <I>q</I><I>awwali </I>attributed to Amir Khusrau, the &#8220;Parrot of India&#8221; and one of the earliest Muslim poets to whom poetry in Hindi is attributed. This song, expressing Amir Khusrau&#8217;s yearnings for his spiritual master, is still re&shy;cited today in Delhi at the shrine of Nizam al-Din Awliya. Sometimes, devotion to the Prophet Muhammad is also expressed using the symbol of the <I>virahini</I>. Characteristically, in <I>mauluds, </I>or poems in praise of the Prophet from the region of Sind, the yearning soul or bride-to-be longs for marriage with Muhammad, the bridegroom of Medina. Abd ur-Rauf Bhatti (died 1752 CE), one of the earliest Sindhi poets to write such poems, sings:<BR><BR>

<P>In some cases, as in the <A href="text_only31a4.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D261%27%29%29"><I>ginan</I>s</A>, the devotional hymns of the Subcontinent&#8217;s Shi&#8216;a Muslim Ismaili com&shy;munity, the <I>virahini</I>&#8217;s<I> </I>beloved can even be in the Shi&#8216;a Imam, who is venerated on account of his spiritual and physical lineage from the Prophet and his role as spiri&shy;tual guide to this particular community.</P>
<P>Muslim writers in the vernacular tradition could ex&shy;press their ideas through a wide variety of other Indic literary forms and devices. In areas of northern India where various dialects of Hindi, such as Awadh, Braj, and Bhojpuri were spoken, they used the romantic epic as a vehicle, probably inspired by the well-established tradition in classical Persian literature of retelling ro&shy;mances such as Layla-Majnun or Farhad-Shirin within a mystical framework. The use of popular Indian ro&shy;mances can be dated to 1379 CE when the Hindi poet Maulana Daud, disciple of a Chishti Sufi master, illus&shy;trated in the Awadhi Hindi epic <I>Chandayan </I>the use of the Indian romance between Lurak and Chanda as a mystical allegory. This epic was so famous that Badauni, the celebrated chronicler, records in the <I>Muntakhab al-tawarikh </I>(composed<I> </I>after 1596 CE) that a Muslim preacher used excerpts from this epic during his sermons because of its ability to capture the hearts of his audience when sung by the sweet singers of Hindustan. Maulana Daud&#8217;s work initiated a brilliant tradition of Islamic mystical epics in Hindi that was to continue well into the late nineteenth century, and in&shy;cluded masterpieces such as Kutuban&#8217;s <I>Mrigavati </I>(composed 1503), Malik Muhammad Jaisi&#8217;s <I>Padmavat</I> (composed 1540), and Manjhan&#8217;s <I>Madhulmalali </I>(com&shy;posed 1545). This epic tradition was an important fac&shy;tor in the development of Hindi prose literature in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</P>
<P>The use of popular romances for conveying Islamic mystical instruction was not confined to Hindi speak&shy;ing areas. By the late fourteenth-century, Shah Muhammad Sagir, a pioneer Muslim poet of the Bengali language, had composed in his mother tongue the epic of Yusuf and Zulaykha, the first of many such works in Bengali. Similarly, Muslim poets in the Punjab were re&shy;sponsible for an impressive series of romantic epics in Punjabi. Yet, it is in the region of Sind where poets de&shy;veloped interesting and innovative ways of utilising the region&#8217;s romances as a tool for mystical education. By 1600, some of the region&#8217;s poets were using traditional Sindhi tales as themes for their Persian epics. Later, writing in their native language Sindhi, they used the heroine of the romance &#8211; and in keeping with the <I>vir</I><I>ahini </I>convention it is always the heroine and never the hero &#8211; as the symbol for the soul longing for union with God through suffering and death. The heroine in these poems always searches for her lost beloved until she either finds him, or dies of thirst and heat in the mountains, or drowns in the river Indus. She becomes the parable of the seeking soul on the mystical path who, separated from the Divine Beloved, must undergo great tribulation and a painful purification process in her quest.<BR><BR>

<TD ></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P>
<P>In the skilful hands of these folk-poets, the tradi&shy;tional heroines are ingeniously endowed with interpre&shy;tations that recall Qur&#8217;anic verses such as &#8220;Verily from God we are and to Him we return&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 2:151) or Qur&#8217;anic concepts such as the primordial covenant be&shy;tween each soul and God (Qur&#8217;an 7:171). The heroine becomes so sublime that her physical and external quest for her Beloved is transformed into a spiritual and internal one. Thus, Shah Abdul Latif&#8217;s heroine, Sassui, who out of negligence lost her beloved Punhun, sings:<BR><BR>

<P>In addition to the romantic epic and its heroine, Muslim poets had at their disposal the whole repertoire of inherited images derived from the range of activities common in rural life such as ploughing, sowing, hunt&shy;ing, and milking. In coastal regions, the worlds of fish&shy;ing and seafaring were a particularly favourite source of inspiration. Lalan, the famous Baul poet of Bengal, ex&shy;plains the role of the Prophet by comparing him to a pi&shy;lot steering the boat of the faithful to salvation:<BR><BR>
<TABLE  cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0>

<P>(Q. A. Mannan and C. Selly<I>, Lyric Poetry</I>)</P></TD>
<TD ></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P>
<P>Many poets also turned to the world of nature and the countryside that surrounded them with symbols: from the swan that has a keen discriminating taste for pure pearls to the lotus flower that symbolises the preservation of purity in the midst of an uncongenial, sullied world. The possibilities were endless as long as the poet was able to effectively blend his religious mes&shy;sage into the image, retain its simplicity, and not weigh it down with burdensome theoretical speculations.</P>
<P>Indeed, vernacular literature frequently condemns barren intellectualism and bookish learning as a means of approaching Allah. As in the case with Sufi poetry in Persian and Turkish, the main targets of criticism were the <I><A href="text_only1195.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D58%27%29%29">ulama</A></I>,<I> </I>the learned theologians and religious jurists who claimed exclusive authority over the interpreta&shy;tion of the Qur&#8217;an on account of their training and edu&shy;cation. According to most vernacular poets, all the knowledge and scholarship in the world was useless in comparison to the experience of a person who has seen the Beloved. The rustic peasant-farmer felt reassured that he, too, his illiteracy notwithstanding, could enjoy a loving relationship with his God when he listened to poets declare that in the path of divine love, it was not necessary to read or write more than the first letter of the Arabic alphabet, the <I>alif</I>,<I> </I>with which begins the name Allah:<BR><BR>

<P>Far more significant than formal education in nur&shy;turing a person&#8217;s spiritual development was the instruction and guidance of the appropriate mystic guide, the <I>pir</I>.<I> </I>Poetry in every vernacular language of South Asia extols the importance and the necessity of having a<I> pir</I>.

Poets em&shy;ployed a variety of images, usually drawn from the ac&shy;tivities of daily life, to explain the <I>pir</I>&#8217;s<I> </I>role. For example, he was compared to a <I>dhobi</I>, a washerman who beats his laundry with a stick to thrash out dirt, or to a dyer who cleans off the spots of impurity from the soul by dipping it in a vat that contains, to use an ex&shy;pression from the Qur&#8217;an (2:132), the <I>sibghat Allah</I>,<I> </I>&#8220;the colouring of Allah&#8221; (Schimmel, <I>Pain</I> <I>and Grace</I>,<I> </I>180). Although the <I>pir </I>may seem to be harsh and cruel in his method of education, he may see this as the best means of furthering the disciple&#8217;s spiritual develop&shy;ment.

This system of mystical speculation, whose fundamentals are summed up in the formula, &#8220;Everything is He,&#8221; greatly influenced the expression of much mystical literature in the Islamic world after the fourteenth century. Thus, while the conservatives were alarmed by the theory since it seemed to blur the dis&shy;tinction between creation and the Creator, poets influ&shy;enced by it wrote pantheistic-sounding verses claiming the fundamental unity of all outward forms of creation.

<P>Not surprising, this philosophy, which is strongly reminiscent of the <I>advaita</I>, a non-dualistic philosophi&shy;cal system in Hinduism, has led several scholars to de&shy;tect a preponderance of &#8220;Vedantic Hindu&#8221; influences in much poetry written by Muslims in Indian languages.</P>
<P>While the extent of Hindu influence is debatable, what remains beyond question is the central role that the vernacular literary tradition accords Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam. Devotion to him is the hallmark of Islamic identity. The Punjabi poet Sultan Bahu, who has been considered by some as the prime example of a Muslim poet influenced by Hindu <I>vedanta</I>, says in this regard:<BR><BR>

<P>Love for the Prophet, as Constance Padwick has emphasised, is the strongest binding force in the Islamic tradition, for it is an emotion in which all levels of so&shy;ciety, from the peasantry to the <I>intelligentsia</I>, can share (<I>Muslim Devotions</I>, 145). The Prophet is the loyal friend, the most trustworthy companion, the interces&shy;sor on the Day of Judgment. Just as the poets of the classical languages Arabic and Persian composed eru&shy;dite eulogies for the Prophet, the vernacular poets wrote moving verses to spark Prophetic love in the hearts of their audience, whether they spoke Sindhi, Punjabi, Hindi, Gujarati, Bengali, Malayalam or Tamil. Lalan, the Baul poet of Bengal, pleads to the Prophet:<BR><BR>

<P>I shall not find again a compassionate friend like you,<BR>You showed yourself, now do not leave, oh<BR>Prophet of faith.<BR>We all were inhabitants of Madina,<BR>But were<I> </I>as<I> </I>though in forest exile,<BR>Then from you we gained wisdom, <BR>We gained solace.</P>

<P>A variety of images, metaphors and verse-forms, many of them derived from the Indian literary milieu, were employed to express themes ranging from the love the Prophet&#8217;s followers felt for him to the protec&shy;tion and kindness that the Prophet Muhammad extended to his community. A Sindhi poet could adopt in his <I>maulud </I>the persona of the <I>virahini</I>,<I> </I>the young woman yearn&shy;ing for the bridegroom Prophet; a Tamil poet could choose to compose a traditional <I>pillaittamil</I>,<I> </I>or a &#8220;baby-poem,&#8221; to describe the Prophet&#8217;s birth and his charming play as a baby, his radiance as a child, and the loving way in which his nurse rocked him in a cradle, which reflected his greatness:<BR><BR>

<P>Perhaps the most beautiful image frequently associ&shy;ated with the Prophet is the cloud of mercy which brings the rain of mercy to a parched and thirsty earth &#8211; a<I> </I>clever reference to the Qur&#8217;anic epithet for the Prophet, &#8220;a mercy for the worlds&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 21:107).</P>
<P><B><A name=islreform>Literatures of Islamic Reform in the Contemporary Period</A></B></P>
<P><B></B></P>
<P>Since the eighteenth century, Muslims in South Asia have experienced drastic changes in the manner in which they articulate their identity and the contexts in which they practice their faith. On the one hand, they have had to respond first to<I> </I>the loss of Muslim political power in the subcontinent and, later, to the creation of an Islamic state, Pakistan. On the other hand, they have had to address a deeply felt need to find a cure for a widespread spiritual and religious malaise. To convey their ideas on these and other issues to the wider Muslim community, reformers and activists, liberal and conservative alike, turned to various literary genres, es&shy;pecially poetry. Notwithstanding the rich diversity of languages spoken by Muslims in South Asia, the Urdu language, due to a complex set of factors, became the symbol of Islamic culture in South Asia and hence the most important literary medium for advocates of re&shy;form and change.</P>
<P>The pioneer of religious reformers in South Asia was Shah Wali Allah (died 1762 CE), the great theologian of Delhi. Although the most important work in which he expressed his thought was in Arabic, the <I>Hujjat Allah al-Baligha</I>,<I> </I>Shah Wali Allah&#8217;s ideas had a deep impact on later reformist writers in Urdu and other languages. Shah Wali Allah felt strongly that the Muslims of South Asia would be better able to live in accordance with the precepts of their faith and begin resolving their socio&shy;-religious problems if they could understand the Qur&#8217;an for themselves without relying on the secondary inter&shy;pretations offered in commentaries. Hence he trans&shy;lated the Holy Book into Persian, paving the way for his two sons Rafi ud-Din (died 1818 CE) and Abd al-Qadir (died 1813 CE) to translate it into Urdu; the latter appropriately called his Urdu translation <I>Mudih al-qur&#8217;an</I>,<I> </I>(<I>Explainer of the Qur&#8217;an</I>).<I> </I>In the subsequent decades, translations of the Qur&#8217;an began to appear in several other Indian languages as well.</P>
<P>Shah Wali Allah and many of his disciples were affil&shy;iated with a branch of the activist Naqshabandi Sufi or&shy;der known as the <A href="text_only9828.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D69%27%29%29">Tariqa</A> Muhammadiyya (The Muhammadan Path). As its name suggests, this move&shy;ment placed strong emphasis on the figure of the<I> </I>Prophet Muhammad as a true and stable paradigm and guide for the Muslim community in a period of political and social flux. The ideology of The Muhammadan Path influenced the writings of many prominent Urdu poets, including the so-called &#8220;pillars of Urdu,&#8221; the stern Mazhar Janjanan (died 1781 CE) and the mystic poet Mir Dard (died 1785 CE). It also inspired numerous biogra&shy;phies of the Prophet and studies of <I>hadith </I>not only in Urdu, but also Sindhi and other languages.</P>
<P>From a literary point of view<I>, </I>the most prominent group of writer-activists in the nineteenth century were associated with Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan (died 1898 CE). As a young man, Sir Sayyid was well-trained in theology in the tradition of Shah Wali Allah, as well as <A href="text_onlydd2a.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D155%27%29%29">Mu&#8216;tazila</A> ra&shy;tionalism. He was also affiliated with the Tariqa Muhammadiyya. After the traumatic 1857 CE rebellion against the British, he was convinced that the best path for the Muslim community to follow was that of ab&shy;solute and<I> </I>unwavering loyalty to British rule. Furthermore, he felt that Muslims should fully partici&shy;pate in the Western-style educational system being es&shy;tablished by the British in India so that they would not become a social and economic underclass. He did not hold Western thought, in particular Western science, to be in fundamental conflict with Islam. To promote his ideas and provide young Muslims with Western-style higher education, he founded at Aligarh the Anglo&shy;-Muhammadan College, which later became Aligarh Muslim University.</P>
<P>Sayyid Ahmad Khan was a fairly prolific writer in Urdu and hoped to influence Muslims through his books as well as his journals. The most significant of these was the monthly Urdu periodical, <I>Tahzib al-Akhlaq </I>(<I>The Cultivation of Morals</I>,<I> </I>also known as the <I>Muhamadan Social Reformer</I>),<I> </I>which revolutionized Urdu journalism. Its pages, written in simple and clear prose, contained articles reflecting Sir Sayyid&#8217;s views on a wide range of issues from public hygiene to ratio&shy;nal speculation on religious dogma.</P>
<P>Sayyid Ahmad Khan&#8217;s approach enjoyed the support of several important personalities in Indo-Muslim soci&shy;ety and formed the basis for the so-called Aligarh movement. Among the members of the movement were several important <I>literati</I> who wrote both Urdu poetry and prose to disseminate its ideas. Most prominent among these was Altaf Husain Hali (died 1914 CE), the founder of Urdu literary criticism. He published in 1879 CE his<I> Madd o gari-i Islam </I>(<I>The Ebb and Flow of Islam</I>),<I> </I>an epic<I> </I>poem considered to be the Aligarh movement&#8217;s most enduring literary monument. Popularly known as the <I>&#8220;</I><I>Musaddas</I>&#8221;<I> </I>after its six line stanzas, it contrasts the past glories and<I> </I>achievements of Islamic civilisation with the poor and miserable status of the Muslims of Hali&#8217;s time. The poem, which was recited aloud at conferences and boldly calligraphed on journals and newspapers, sharply attacked the evils prevalent in all segments of the Indian Muslim community.</P>
<P>Some of Hali&#8217;s poems, such as &#8220;<I>Ek biwi ki munajat</I>&#8221; (&#8220;A Woman&#8217;s Petition&#8221;), focus on the plight of women in Muslim society. This theme was taken up by several reformist writers, including Nazir Ahmad (died 1912 CE), one of the pioneers in the development of the Urdu novel. By profession a teacher, he was a firm believer in the importance of educating young people, in partic&shy;ular young women. Most of his novels, therefore, illus&shy;trated social or moral themes, showing the need for reform and change. His most famous book, <I>Mirat </I><I>al-arus</I> (The Bride&#8217;s Mirror), emphasised the need for female education by highlighting the miseries of an uneducated Muslim bride. In other works he addresses the evils of polygamy and attacks the taboo in Indian society against the remarriage of widows, which he felt was contrary to the spirit of Islam. Notwithstanding their didactic and moralistic tone, his works were tremendously popular for their realistic descriptions of middle-class Muslim life. They also inspired similar works in other languages such as Sindhi. Other members of Sir Sayyid&#8217;s circle were equally concerned about improving the status of women, particularly Mumtaz Ali. He devoted most of his energies to this important issue and even published a special journal, <I>Tahzib al-niswan</I>, containing articles on women&#8217;s issues. In his major work, <I><A href="text_only41f6.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D242%27%29%29">Huquq</A> al-niswan</I> (<I>The Rights of Women</I>), he advocates complete equality between men and women.<I></I></P>
<P>In the twentieth century, the personality whose liter&shy;ary works have had the most profound influence on the Muslim community is Sir Muhammad Iqbal (died 1938 CE). The reformist poetry of this poet-philosopher had such a powerful impact that he is counted among the most significant thinkers of modern Islam. He is also widely considered to be the spiritual father of Pakistan, as he was the first to advocate the idea of a separate Muslim homeland.<I></I></P>
<P><I></I></P>
<P>Iqbal received his early education in Lahore, influ&shy;enced in his thought by, among others, the modernist Sir Sayyid Ahmad, the historian Shibli, and Sir Thomas Arnold, an Orientalist who attempted to revive a less polemical and more sympathetic understanding of Islam in western scholarship. In many ways Iqbal was also the inheritor of the ideas of Shah Waliullah and<I> </I>Hali whose poetic style he followed. At the turn of the century he had become well-known for his Urdu poems expressing nationalist ideas, Hindu-Muslim solidarity and freedom for India. One of his poems from this pe&shy;riod, &#8220;<I>Tarana yi Hind</I>,&#8221; praised the glories of Hindustan and is still popular in India today.<I></I></P>
<P>In 1905 lqbal went to Cambridge<I> </I>where he studied Hegelian philosophy, proceeding in 1907 to Munich where he received his doctorate for a thesis entitled <I>The Development of Metaphysics in Persia</I>.<I> </I>Iqbal&#8217;s stay in Europe was instrumental in the further evolu&shy;tion of his reformist ideas and allowed him to become familiar with the philosophy of Nietzsche and Bergson. On his return to India, though he was offered a position at Aligarh, Iqbal preferred to practice law. At heart, however, he was primarily a poet and used his poetry to articulate his thought in a manner that is unprece&shy;dented in modern Islamic history. His verse<I>, </I>with its di&shy;rect style devoid of the traditional flowery language and literary acrobatics, had a tremendous appeal for the Indian Muslims who were searching for leaders with an intellectual and political vision.</P>
<P>In his first major reformist Urdu poem &#8220;<I>Shikwa</I>&#8221;<I> </I>(&#8220;The Complaint&#8221;), written in 1911 &#8211; he complains to Allah for being fickle and having abandoned the faith&shy;ful Muslims in favour of the infidels. A year later he composed a reply in the form of &#8220;<I>Jawab-i</I> <I>Shikwa</I>&#8221;<I> </I>(&#8220;The Answer to the Complaint&#8221;), in which Allah points out the defects in the way Muslims practice and understand their faith. Both poems were clearly inspired by Hali&#8217;s &#8220;<I>Musaddas</I>&#8221;.<I> </I>During the war, Iqbal composed two major works, &#8220;<I>Asrar-i Khudi</I>&#8221; (&#8220;Secrets of the Self&#8221;) and &#8220;<I>Rumuz Bekhudi</I>&#8221; (&#8220;Mysteries of Selflessness&#8221;).<I> </I>These, like all his major<I> </I>philosophical poems, he chose to write in Persian, for he intended his ideas to reach an audience beyond the Subcontinent. It is here that he reinterpreted the Persian mystical concept of<I> khudi </I>(ego) in a positive sense, articulating the dynamic role of the individual in society. His stress, here and in his other Urdu and Persian poems, was on activity and dynamism at both the individual and communal level. He believed that each human, as the vicegerent of God on earth, had a duty to actively<I> </I>develop himself or herself to the high&shy;est potential. In 1924 Iqbal published a major collection of Urdu poems under the title, <I>Bang-i</I> <I>dara </I>(The Call of Caravan Bell).<I> </I>The title is significant for it re&shy;flects Iqbal&#8217;s perception of his role and his message: he is the bell at the head of the caravan arousing the sleeping and erring Muslims of India into activity, lead&shy;ing them to the centre of Islam, the Ka&#8216;ba in Mecca. By this time his poetry was considered so important and had garnered so much attention, he was knighted in 1922 by the<I> </I>British monarch.</P>
<P>For the next ten years, Iqbal published most of his significant writing in either English, as with <I>Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam</I>,<I> </I>or<I> </I>Persian, as with <I>Zabur-i</I> <I>ajam </I>(The Stroke of Moses).<I> </I>The former contains some of the finest of Iqbal&#8217;s Urdu poems (including a renowned piece on the Mosque of Cordoba that recalls the past glory of Muslims). The po&shy;ems of the latter are mainly critiques of the existing po&shy;litical and social order, critical of the British and of Muslims who ape Western ways blindly.</P>
<P>Iqbal is the most famous of several authors whose writings have had a deep impact on the Muslim com&shy;munity in recent times. Like other Muslim writers in the contemporary period, he draws extensively on the Turko-Persian and the Indic heritage of Indo-Muslim lit&shy;erature, yet incorporates also the legacy of Western thought. Iqbal&#8217;s fame lies in the unique way he inter&shy;prets and expresses Islamic concepts and ideas through a skilful combination of Western and Eastern intellectual and literary tools. That he and other poets such as Faiz Ahmad Faiz (died 1984 CE) could effectively use poetry as a medium to spread their ideas far and wide attests to the fact that literature, oral and written, continues to be a vibrant force in South Asian Muslim culture today as it has been in centuries past.</P>
