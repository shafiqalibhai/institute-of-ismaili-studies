Early Ismaili <I>da&#8217;wa</I> took advantage of the fact that there were many discontented factions among the Abbasid populace. Acquiring the allegiance of these groups facilitated the eventual establishment of the Fatimid caliphate. </DIV>
<DIV><BR>During the reign of the <A title=ContentLink.asp?type=glossary&amp;id=269 onclick="return LaunchGlossary(this.href);" href="text_only8039.html?s=%2FContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D269" target=_blank>Fatimids</A>, the <I>da&#8217;wa</I> structure continued to be refined and expanded. Within the Fatimid state, the <I>da&#8217;wa</I> enjoyed unbridled freedom to propagate the faith and expound upon ideological developments. However, the Fatimid&#8217;s policies of tolerance and freedom of religion prevented Ismailism from ever rooting deeply into the North African population. It remained the faith of a minority for the duration of the Fatimid reign. </DIV>
<DIV><BR>Ironically, outside the Fatimid <A href="text_only2b1c.html?s=%2FContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D283"><I>dawla</I></A>, the <I>da&#8217;wa</I> was more successful in establishing significant Ismaili communities across Asia and into the Subcontinent. It is this stability, achieved outside Fatimid territory, which allowed Ismailism&#8217;s survival and continuation after the decline of the Fatimid dynastic rule. </DIV></div><div> </div><div><P class=mainhead><STRONG>Keywords</STRONG></P>

The over-all aim of this dynamic and centrally-directed movement of social protest was to uproot the Abbasids and install the &#8216;Alid Imam acknowledged by the Ismailis to the actual rule of the Islamic community (<I>umma</I>).

<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>The early Ismaili <I>da&#8217;wa</I> achieved particular success among those Imami Shi'is of Iraq, Persia and elsewhere, later designated as <I>ithna&#8217;ashariyya</I> (Twelvers), who had been left in a state of disarray and confusion following the death of their 11th Imam and the simultaneous disappearance of his infant son Muhammad in 260/874. These Imamis shared the same early theological heritage with the Ismailis, especially the Imami doctrine of the Imamate. This doctrine, which provided the central teaching of the Twelver and Ismaili Shi&#8216;is, was based on the belief in the permanent need of mankind for a divinely guided, sinless and infallible (<I>ma&#8217;sum</I>) Imam who, after the Prophet Muhammad, would act as the authoritative teacher and guide of men in all their spiritual affairs. This Imam was entitled to temporal leadership as much as to religious authority; his mandate, however, did not depend on his actual rule. The doctrine further taught that the Prophet himself had designated his cousin and son-in-law <A onclick="return LaunchGlossary(this.href);" href="text_onlyde59.html?s=ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D335" target=_blank>Ali b.

<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>By 286/899, when the Ismailis themselves split into the loyal Fatimid Ismaili and the dissident Qarmati factions, significant Ismaili communities had appeared in numerous regions of the Arab world and throughout the Iranian lands, as well as in North Africa where the Kutama and other <A onclick="return LaunchGlossary(this.href);" href="text_onlyb28b.html?s=ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D305" target=_blank>Berber</A> tribal confederations had responded to the summons of the Ismaili <I>da&#8217;wa</I>.

In the same eventful year 286/899, the Qarmatis founded a powerful state of their own in Bahrayn, which survived in rivalry with the Fatimid state until 470/1077.<A href="#anchor32_3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> </SPAN></P>

<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>The success of the early Ismaili <I>da&#8217;wa</I> was crowned in 297/909 by the establishment of the Fatimid state or <I>dawla</I> in North Africa, in <A onclick="return LaunchGlossary(this.href);" href="text_onlyad8b.html?s=ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D232" target=_blank>Ifriqiya</A> (today&#8217;s Tunisia and eastern Algeria).

Not since the time of 'Ali, had the Shi'a witnessed the succession of an &#8216;Alid to the actual leadership of an important Islamic state. By acquiring political power, and then transforming the nascent Fatimid <I>dawla</I> into a flourishing empire, the Ismaili Imam presented his Shi&#8217;i challenge to &#8216;Abbasid hegemony and Sunni interpretations of Islam. Ismailism, too, had now found its own place among the state-sponsored communities of interpretation in Islam. Henceforth, the Fatimid caliph-Imam could claim to act as the spiritual spokesman of Shi&#8217;i Islam in general, much like the &#8216;Abbasid <A onclick="return LaunchGlossary(this.href);" href="text_onlyd829.html?s=ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D299" target=_blank>caliph</A> was the mouthpiece of Sunni Islam. </SPAN></P>

At the same time, a manifesto was read from the pulpits announcing that leadership had finally come to be vested in the <I>Ahl al-bayt</I>. As one of the first acts of the new regime, the jurists of Ifriqiya were instructed to give their legal opinions in accordance with the Shi&#8217;i principles of jurisprudence. The new caliphate and dynasty came to be known as Fatimid (Fatimiyya), derived from the name of the Prophet&#8217;s daughter Fatima, to whom al-Mahdi and his successors traced their ancestry. </SPAN></P>

<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>The ground for the establishment of the Fatimid caliphate in Ifriqiya had been carefully prepared since 280/893 by the <I>da&#8217;i</I> Abu &#8216;Abd Allah al-Shi&#8217;i, who had been active among the Kutama Berbers of the <A href="text_only0ee1.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D187%27%29%29">Lesser Kabylia</A>.

It is to be noted, however, that Shi&#8216;ism had never taken deep roots in North Africa, where the native Berbers generally adhered to diverse schools of Kharijism while Qayrawan, founded as a garrison town and inhabited by Arab warriors, remained the stronghold of Maliki Sunnism. Under such circumstances, the newly converted Berbers' understanding of Ismailism, which at the time still lacked a distinctive school of law (<I><A href="text_only457a.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D184%27%29%29">madhhab</A></I>), was rather superficial - a phenomenon that remained essentially unchanged in subsequent decades. The <I>da&#8217;i</I> al-Shi&#8217;i personally taught the Kutama initiates Ismaili tenets in regular lectures.

<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>The Fatimid caliph-Imam al-Mahdi (d. 322/934) and his next three successors, ruling from Ifriqiya, encountered numerous difficulties while consolidating the pillars of their state. In addition to the continued animosity of the Abbasids, and the Umayyads of Spain, who as rival claimants to the caliphate entertained their own designs for North Africa, the early Fatimids had numerous military entanglements with the <A href="text_only70ae.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D300%27%29%29">Byzantine</A>s. They also devoted much of their energy to subduing the rebellions of the Khariji Berbers, especially those belonging to the Zanata confederation, and the hostilities of the Sunni inhabitants of the cities of Ifriqiya led by their influential Maliki jurists. All this made it extremely difficult for the early Fatimids to secure control over any region of the Maghrib, beyond the heartland of Ifriqiya, for any extended period. It also made the propagation of the Ismaili <I>da'wa</I> rather impractical in the Maghrib. In fact, `Abd Allah al-Mahdi and his immediate successors did not actively engage in the extension of their <I><A href="text_only627b.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D286%27%29%29">da'wa</A></I> in order to avoid hostile reactions of the majoritarian Khariji and Sunni inhabitants of North Africa. Nevertheless, the Ismailis were now for the first time permitted to practise their faith openly and without fearing persecution within Fatimid dominions, while outside the boundaries of their state they were obliged, as before, to observe <I><A href="text_onlya7a5.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D71%27%29%29">taqiyya</A></I> or precautionary dissimulation of their true beliefs.</SPAN></P>
<P><A name=anchor8></A><B class=bodytext>Continuation of the <I>da'wa</I> and Codification of Ismaili Law</B> </P>
<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>In line with their universal claims the Fatimid caliph-Imams had, however, not abandoned their <I>da'wa</I> aspirations on assuming power. Claiming to possess sole legitimate religious authority, the Fatimids aimed to extend their authority and rule over the entire Muslim <I>umma</I> and even the regions of the world inhabited by non-Muslims. As a result, they retained the network of <I>da&#8216;is</I> operating on their behalf both within and outside Fatimid dominions, although initially they effectively refrained from <I>da&#8217;wa</I> activities within the Fatimid state. It took the Fatimids several decades to formally establish their rule in North Africa. Only the 4th Fatimid caliph-Imam, al-Mu<I>&#8216;</I>izz (341-365/953-975), was able to pursue successfully policies of war and diplomacy, also concerning himself specifically with the affairs of the Ismaili <I>da&#8217;wa</I>. His overall aim was to extend the universal authority of the Fatimids at the expense of their major rivals, namely, the Umayyads of Spain, the Byzantines and above all, the Abbasids. The process of codifying Ismaili law, too, attained its climax under al-Mu<I>&#8216;</I>izz mainly through the efforts of al-Qadi al-Nu&#8217;man (d. 363/974), the foremost Fatimid jurist. Al-Mu&#8217;izz officially commissioned al-Nu&#8217;man, who headed the Fatimid judiciary from 337/948 in the reign of the 3rd Fatimid caliph-Imam al-Mansur, to promulgate an Ismaili <I>madhhab</I>. His efforts culminated in the compilation of the <I>Da</I>&#8216;<I>a'im al-!slam</I> (<I>The Pillars of Islam</I>), which was endorsed by al-Mu&#8217;izz as the official code of the Fatimid <I>dawla</I>. The Ismailis, too, now possessed a system of law and jurisprudence as well as an Ismaili paradigm of governance. </SPAN></P>
<P><A name=anchor9></A><SPAN class=bodytext><B>Key Tenets of Ismaili Law</B></SPAN> </P>
<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>As developed by al-Nu&#8217;man. Ismaili law accorded special importance to the central Shi<I>&#8216;</I>i doctrine of the Imamate. In fact, the opening chapter in the <I>Da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>a'im al-Islam</I>, which relates to <I>walaya</I>, explains the necessity of acknowledging the rightful Imam of the time, viz., the Fatimid caliph-Imam, also providing Islamic legitimation for the <I>&#8216;</I>Alid state ruled by the Fatimids belonging to the Prophet&#8217;s family. In fact, the authority of the infallible Fatimid <I>&#8216;</I>Alid Imam and his teachings were listed as the 3rd principal source of Ismaili law, after the Qur'an and the <I><A href="text_only8e00.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D83%27%29%29">sunna</A></I> of the Prophet which are accepted as the first 2 sources by all Muslims. In sum, it was al-Qadi al-Nu&#8217;man who elaborated in his legal compendia a doctrinal basis for the Fatimids&#8217; legitimacy as ruling caliph-Imams, also lending support to their universal claims.<A href="#anchor32_5">5</A></SPAN></P>

<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>Al-Mu&#8216;izz, as noted, was the first member of his dynasty to have concerned himself with the Ismaili <I>da&#8217;wa</I> outside Fatimid dominions. In addition to preparing the ideological ground for Fatimid rule, his <I>da&#8217;wa</I> strategy was based on a number of more specific religio-political considerations. The propaganda of the Qarmatis of Bahrayn, Iraq, Persia and elsewhere, who had continuously refused to recognise the Imamate of the Fatimids, generally undermined the Ismaili <I>da&#8217;wa</I> and the activities of the Fatimid <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>is</I> in the same regions. It was, indeed, mainly due to the doctrines and practices of the Qarmatis that the entire Ismaili movement was accused by the Sunni polemicists and heresiographers of <A onclick="return LaunchGlossary(this.href);" href="text_only9397.html?s=ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D209" target=_blank><EM>ilhad</EM></A> or deviation in religion, as these hostile sources did not distinguish between the dissident Qarmatis and those Ismailis who acknowledged the Fatimid caliphs as their Imams. The anti-Ismaili literary campaign of the Sunni establishment, dating mainly to the foundation of Fatimid rule, was particularly intensified in the aftermath of the Qarmatis&#8217; sack of Mecca in 317/930. At any rate, al-Mu&#8216;izz must have also recognised the military advantages of winning the support of the formidable Qarmati armies, which would have significantly enhanced the chances of the Fatimids&#8217; victory over the Abbasids in the central Islamic lands. It was in line with these objectives that al-Mu&#8216;izz made certain doctrinal adjustments, rooted in the teachings of the early Ismailis and designed to prove appealing to the Qarmatis.<A href="#anchor32_6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> Perhaps as a concession to the Qarmati camp, al-Mu&#8216;izz and the Fatimid <I>da</I>&#8216;<I>wa</I> also endorsed the Neoplatonised cosmology first propounded by the Qarmati <I>da&#8217;i</I> Muhammad al-Nasafi (d. 332/943) in his <I>Kitab al-mahsul</I> (<I>Book of the Yeld</I>) around 300/912.

<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>Meanwhile, al-Mu&#8216;izz had made detailed plans for the conquest of Egypt, a vital Fatimid goal which the first two members of the dynasty had failed to achieve.

Jawhar behaved leniently towards Egyptians, declaring a general amnesty. Subsequently, the Fatimids introduced the Ismaili <I>madhhab</I> only gradually in Egypt, where Shi&#8216;ism had never acquired a stronghold. Fatimid Egypt remained primarily Sunni, of the Shafi&#8216;i <I>madhhab</I>, with an important community of Christian Copts. The Fatimids never attempted forced conversion of their subjects and the minoritarian status of the Shi&#8216;a remained unchanged in Egypt despite two centuries of Ismaili Shi&#8216;i rule.</SPAN></P>
<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>Jawhar camped his army to the north of Fustat and immediately proceeded to build a new royal city there, the future Fatimid capital <A href="text_onlyaa39.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D138%27%29%29">al-Qahira </A>(Cairo).

Jawhar ruled over Egypt for 4 years until the arrival of al-Mu&#8216;izz.

In Egypt, al-Mu&#8216;izz was mainly preoccupied with the elaboration of Fatimid governance in addition to repelling further Qarmati incursions.

<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>The organisation and functioning of the Ismaili <I>da&#8217;wa</I> are among the most secretly guarded aspects of Fatimid Ismailism. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Ismaili literature of the Fatimid period recovered in modern times has shed only limited light on this subject. Information is particularly meagre regarding the <I>da&#8217;wa</I> and the activities of the <I>da&#8217;is</I> in hostile regions outside the Fatimid <I>dawla</I>, such as Iraq, Persia. Central Asia and India, where the <I>da&#8217;is</I>, fearful of persecution, were continuously obliged to observe <I>taqiyya</I> and secrecy in their operations. All this once again explains why Ismaili literature is generally so poor in historiographical details on the activities of the <I>da&#8217;is</I> - information that in Fatimid times may have been available only to the central headquarters of the Ismaili <I>da&#8217;wa</I>, headed by the person of the Imam. However, modern scholarship in Ismaili studies, drawing on a variety of Ismaili and non-Ismaili sources, including histories of Egypt, has now finally succeeded to piece together a relatively reliable sketch of the Fatimid Ismaili <I>da&#8217;wa</I>, with some of its major practices and institutions. </SPAN></P>

It should also be noted that at least from Fatimid times several categories of <I>da</I><I>&#8217;</I><I>is </I>existed in any region. Be that as it may, the term <I>da</I><I>&#8217;</I><I>i</I> (plural, <I>du</I><I>&#8217;</I><I>at</I>) was applied generically to any authorised representative of the Fatimid <I>da</I><I>&#8217;</I><I>wa</I>, a missionary responsible for propagating Ismailism through winning new converts, and followers for the Ismaili Imam of the time. As the provision of instruction in Ismaili doctrine for the initiates was from early on an important responsibility of the <I>da</I><I>&#8217;</I><I>wa</I>, the <I>da</I><I>&#8217;</I><I>i</I> was also entrusted with the religious education of the new converts or <I><A href="text_only50ef.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D156%27%29%29">mustajib</A>s</I>. Furthermore, the Ismaili <I>da</I><I>&#8217;</I><I>i</I> served as the unofficial agent of the Fatimid <I>dawla</I>, and promoted secretly the Fatimid cause wherever he operated. The earliest record of this aspect of the <I>da</I><I>&#8217;</I><I>is</I> activity is best exemplified in the achievements of the <I>da</I><I>&#8217;</I><I>i</I> Abu &#8216;Abd Allah al-Shi&#8216;i (d. 298/911) in North Africa. Within Fatimid dominions, the Ismaili <I>da</I><I>&#8217;</I><I>wa</I> was protected by the Fatimid <I>dawla</I> and doubtless some collaborative relationship must have existed between them as both were headed by the person of the caliph-Imam.<A href="#anchor32_10"><SUP>10</SUP></A></SPAN></P>
<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>Despite his all-important role, however, very little seems to have been written on the <I>da</I><I>&#8217;</I><I>i</I> by the Ismaili authors of Fatimid times.

The <I>dai&#8216;s</I>, especially those operating in remote lands outside Fatimid dominions, seem to have enjoyed a high degree of autonomy, and they evidently received only their general directives from the central <I>da&#8216;wa</I> headquarters.

<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>Under these circumstances, only Ismailis of high educational qualifications combined with proper moral and intellectual attributes could become <I>da&#8216;is</I> leading Ismaili communities in particular localities.

As a result, a great number of <I>da&#8216;is</I> were highly learned and cultured scholars and made important contributions to Islamic thought.

Only after this oath the <I>da&#8216;i</I> began instructing the <I>mustajib</I>, usually in regular &#8220;teaching sessions&#8221; held at his house for a number of such adepts. The funds required by the <I>da&#8216;i</I> for the performance of his various duties were raised locally from the members of his community.

<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>The scholarly qualifications required of the <I>da&#8216;is</I> and the Fatimids<I>&#8217;</I> high esteem for learning resulted in a number of distinctive traditions and institutions under the Fatimids. The <I>da&#8216;wa</I> was, as noted, concerned with the religious education of converts, who had to be duly instructed in Ismaili esoteric doctrine or <I>hikma</I>. For that purpose, a variety of &#8220;teaching sessions&#8221;, generally designated as <I>majalis</I> (singular, <I>majlis</I>), were organised. These sessions, addressed to different audiences, were formalised by the time of the Fatimid caliph-Imam al-Hakim (386-411/996-1021).<A href="#anchor32_15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> The lectures on Ismaili doctrine, the <I>majalis al-hikma</I>, as noted, were initiated by the <I>da&#8216;i</I> Abu'Abd Allah al-Shi&#8216;i, and then systematised by al-Qadi al-Nu&#8216;man. In the Fatimid state, from early on, the private <I>majalis al-hikma</I>, organised for the exclusive benefit of the Ismaili initiates, were held separately for men and women. These lectures, delivered by the chief <I><A href="text_only1067.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D296%27%29%29">da&#8216;i</A></I> (<I>da&#8216;i al-du&#8216;at</I>) who was often also the chief <I>qadi</I> (<I>qadi al-qudat</I>) of the Fatimid state, required the prior approval of the Fatimid caliph-Imam. There were also public lectures on Ismaili law. The legal doctrines of the Ismaili <I>madhhab</I>, adopted as the official system of religious law in the Fatimid state, were applied by the Fatimid judiciary, headed by the chief <I>qadi</I>. But the Ismaili legal code, governing the juridical basis of the daily life of the Muslim subjects of the Fatimid state, was new and its precepts had to be explained to Ismaili as well as non-Ismaili Muslims. As a result, public sessions on the sharia as interpreted by Ismaili jurisprudence, were held by al-Qadi al-Nu'man and his successors as chief <I>qadis</I>, after the Friday midday prayers, in the Fatimid capital. In Cairo, the public sessions on Ismaili law were held at al-Azhar and other great mosques there. On these occasions, excerpts from al-Nu&#8216;man<I>&#8217;</I>s <I>Da</I>&#8216;<I>a&#8216;im al-Islam</I> and other legal works were read to large audiences.</SPAN></P>
<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>On the other hand, the private <I>majalis al-hikma</I> continued to be held in the Fatimid palace in Cairo for the Ismaili initiates who had already taken the oath of allegiance and secrecy. Many of these <I>majalis</I>, normally prepared by or for the chief <I>da&#8216;i</I>, were in time collected in writing.

As the <I>hujja</I> of Khurasan, he originally established his secret base of operations in his native Balkh (near today&#8217;s Mazar-i Sharif in northern Afghanistan). A few years later, Sunni hostilities obliged him to take permanent refuge in the valley of Yumgan in Badakhshan. There, enjoying the protection of a local Ismaili <I>amir</I>, Nasir spent the rest of his life in the service of the <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>wa</I>.

Nasir Khusraw died not long after 462/1070, and his mausoleum is still preserved near Faydabad, the capital of Afghan Badakhshan. </SPAN></P>

<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>From the latter part of Ahmad al-Mukarram's reign (459-477/1067-1084), when the Sulayhids lost much of northern Yaman to Zaydis, effective authority in the Sulayhid state was exercised by his consort, al-Malika al-Sayyida Hurra, a most remarkable queen and Ismaili leader.<A href="#anchor32_30"><SUP>30</SUP></A> She played an increasingly important role in the affairs of the Yamani <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>wa</I> culminating in her appointment as the <I>hujja</I> of Yaman by al-Mustansir. This represented the first application of a high rank in the <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>wa</I> hierarchy to a woman. Al-Mustansir also charged her with the affairs of the <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>wa</I> in western India. The Sulayhids played a major part in the renewed efforts of the Fatimids to spread Ismailism on the Indian subcontinent, an objective related to Fatimid trade interests. At any rate, from around 460/1067, Yamani <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>is</I> were dispatched to Gujarat under the close supervision of the Sulayhids. These <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>is</I> founded a new Ismaili community in Gujarat which in time grew into the present Tayyibi <A onclick="return LaunchGlossary(this.href);" href="text_only722f.html?s=ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D303" target=_blank>Bohra</A> community. </SPAN></P>
<P class=bodytext><B class=bodytext><A name=anchor27></A>Fatimid Decline and Dissension</B></P>
<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>By the early decades of al-Mustansir&#8217;s long reign (427-487/1036-1094), the Fatimid caliphate had already embarked on its political decline. In rapid succession, the Fatimids now lost almost all of their possessions outside Egypt proper, with the exception of a few coastal towns in the Levant. Al-Mustansir&#8217;s death in 487/1094 and the ensuing dispute over his succession led to a major schism in the Ismaili <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>wa</I> as well, aggravating the deteriorating situation of the Fatimid regime. Al-Mustansir&#8217;s eldest surviving son and heir designate, Nizar, was deprived of his succession rights by the scheming and ambitious al-Afdal, who a few months earlier had succeeded his own father Badr al-Jamali (d. 487/1094) as the all-powerful Fatimid vizier and &#8220;commander of the armies&#8221; (<A onclick="return LaunchGlossary(this.href);" href="text_only9718.html?s=ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D332" target=_blank><EM>amir al-juyush</EM></A>). Al-Afdal installed Nizar's much younger half-brother Ahmad to the Fatimid caliphate with the title of al-Musta&#8217; li bi&#8217;llah, and he immediately obtained for him the allegiance of the <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>wa</I> leaders in Cairo. In protest, Nizar rose in revolt in Alexandria, but was defeated and executed soon afterwards in 488/1095. These events permanently split the Ismaili <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>wa</I> and community into 2 rival factions, designated as Musta&#8217;liyya and <A href="text_only7d5a.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D147%27%29%29">Nizariyya</A> after al-Mustansir&#8217;s sons who had claimed his heritage. The Imamate of al-Musta&#8217;li, who had actually succeeded his father on the Fatimid throne, was recognised by the <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>wa</I> organisation in Cairo, henceforth serving as central headquarters of the Musta&#8217;li Ismaili <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>wa</I>, and by the Ismailis of Egypt, Yaman and western India, who depended on the Fatimid establishment. In Syria, too, the bulk of the Ismailis seem to have initially joined the Musta&#8217;li camp. The situation was drastically different in the eastern Islamic lands where the Fatimids no longer exercised any political influence after the Basasiri episode. </SPAN></P>
<P class=bodytext><B class=bodytext><A name=anchor28></A>The Nizaris Split from Fatimid Headquarters</B></P>
<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>By 487/1094, Hasan Sabbah, a most capable strategist and organiser, had emerged as chief <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>i</I> of the Ismailis of Persia and, probably, of all Saljuq territories. Earlier, Hasan had spent 3 years in Egypt, furthering his Ismaili education and closely observing the difficulties of the Fatimid state. On his return to Persia in 473/1081, Hasan operated as a Fatimid <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>i</I> in different Persian provinces while developing his own ideas for organising an open revolt against the Saljuqs. The revolt was launched in 483/1090 by Hasan&#8217;s seizure of the mountain fortress of <A onclick="return LaunchGlossary(this.href);" href="text_only64b0.html?s=ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D336" target=_blank>Alamut</A> in northern Persia, which henceforth served as his headquarters. At the time of al-Mustansir's succession-dispute Hasan was already following an independent revolutionary policy; and he did not hesitate to uphold Nizar&#8217;s rights and break off his relations with the Fatimid establishment and the <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>wa </I>headquarters in Cairo. This decision, fully supported by the entire Ismaili communities of Persia and Iraq, in fact marked the foundation of the independent Nizari Ismaili <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>wa</I> on behalf of the Nizari Imam who was then inaccessible. Hasan Sabbah also succeeded in creating a state, centred at Alamut, with vast territories and an intricate network of fortresses scattered in different parts of Persia as well as in Syria. Hasan Sabbah (d. 518/1124) and his next two successors at Alamut, Kiya Buzurg-Umid and his son Muhammad, ruled as<I> <A href="text_only1067.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D296%27%29%29">da'i</A>s</I> and <I>hujjas</I> representing the absent Nizari Imam. By 559/1164, the Nizari Imams themselves emerged openly at Alamut and took charge of the affairs of their <I>da'wa</I> and state.<A href="#anchor32_31"><SUP>31</SUP></A> The Nizari state lasted for some 166 years until it too was uprooted by the Mongol hordes in 654/1256. However, the Nizari Ismaili <I>da'wa</I> and community survived the Mongol catastrophe. The Nizari Ismailis, who currently recognise the <A href="text_only9e31.html?s=ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Duser%26amp%3Bid%3D100114">Aga Khan</A> as their Imam, are today found in more than twenty-five countries of Asia, Africa, Europe and North America. </SPAN></P>
<P class=bodytext><B class=bodytext><A name=anchor29></A>Fatimid Disintegration</B></P>
<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>In the meantime, Musta&#8217;li Ismailism had witnessed an internal schism of its own with seminal consequences. On al-Musta&#8217;li&#8217;s premature death in 495/1101, all Musta&#8217;li Ismailis recognised al-amir, his son and successor to the Fatimid caliphate, as their Imam. Due to the close relations then still existing between Sulayhid Yaman and Fatimid Egypt, Queen al-Sayyida, too, acknowledged al-amir&#8217;s Imamate. The assassination of al-amir in 524/1130 confronted the Musta'li <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>wa</I> and communities with a major crisis. By then, the Fatimid caliphate was disintegrating rapidly, while the Sulayhid state was beset by its own mounting difficulties. It was under such circumstances that on al-amir&#8217;s death, power was assumed as regent in the Fatimid state by his cousin <I>&#8216;</I>Abd al-Majid, while al-amir&#8217;s infant son and designated successor al-Tayyib had disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Shortly afterwards in 526/1132, <I>&#8216;</I>Abd al-Majid successfully claimed the Fatimid caliphate as well as the Imamate of the Musta&#8217;li Ismailis with the title of al-Hafiz li-Din Allah. The irregular accession of al-Hafiz was endorsed, as in the case of al-Musta&#8217;li, by the <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>wa</I> headquarters in Cairo; and, therefore, it also received the support of the Musta&#8217;li communities of Egypt and Syria, who were dependent on the Fatimids. These Musta&#8217;li Ismailis, recognising al-Hafiz (d. 544/1149) and the later Fatimid caliphs as their Imams, became known as hafiziyya. </SPAN></P>
<P class=bodytext><B class=bodytext><A name=anchor30></A>Further Offshoots</B></P>
<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>In Yaman, too, some Musta&#8217;lis, led by the Zuray&#8217;ids of <I>&#8216;</I>Adan who had won their independence from the Sulayhids, supported the Hafizi <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>wa</I>. On the other hand, the aged Sulayhid queen al-Sayyida who had already drifted apart from the Fatimid regime, upheld the rights of al-Tayyib and recognised him as al-amir&#8217;s successor to the Imamate. Consequently, she severed her ties with Fatimid Cairo, much in the same way as her contemporary Hasan Sabbah had done a few decades earlier on al-Mustansir&#8217;s death. Her decision was fully endorsed by the Musta&#8217;li community of Gujarat. The Sulayhid queen herself continued to take care of the Yamani <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>wa</I> supporting al-Tayyib&#8217;s Imamate, later designated as Tayyibiyya. Until her death in 532/1138, al-Sayyida worked systematically for the consolidation of the Tayyibi <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>wa</I>. In fact, soon after 526/1132 she appointed al-Dhu&#8217;ayb b. Musa al-Wadi&#8217;i (d. 546/1151) as <I>al-da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>i al-mutlaq</I>, or the <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>i</I> with absolute authority over the affairs of the Yamani <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>wa</I>. This marked the foundation of the independent Tayyibi Musta&#8217;li <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>wa</I> on behalf of al-Tayyib and his successors to the Tayyibi Imamate all of whom have remained inaccessible<SUP>.</SUP><A href="#anchor32_32"><SUP>32</SUP></A><SUP> </SUP>The Tayyibi <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>wa</I> was, thus, made independent of the Fatimids as well as the Sulayhids: and as such, it survived the downfall of both dynasties. The Tayyibi <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>wa</I> was initially led for several centuries from Yaman by al-Dhu&#8217;ayb&#8217;s successors as <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>is</I>. In subsequent times, the stronghold of Tayyibi Ismailism was transferred to the Indian subcontinent and the community subdivided into several groups: the 2 major (Da&#8217; udi-Sulaymani) groups still possess the authorities of their separate lines of <I>da</I><I>&#8216;</I><I>i mutlaqs</I> while awaiting the emergence of their Imam. The Tayyibi Ismailis have also preserved a good share of the Ismaili literature of the Fatimid period. </SPAN></P>

<P class=bodytext><SPAN class=bodytext>On 7 <A href="text_only0c3f-2.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D167%27%29%29">Muharram</A> 567/10 September 1171, Saladin, ironically the last Fatimid vizier, formally ended Fatimid rule by instituting the <I>khutba</I> in Cairo in the name of the reigning <I>&#8216;</I>Abbasid caliph. At the time, al-<I>&#8216;</I>Adid, destined to be the seal of the Fatimid dynasty, lay dying in his palace. The Fatimid <I>dawla</I> collapsed uneventfully after 26 years amidst the complete apathy of the Egyptian populace.
