                <p><span style="color: #11329E; font-weight:bold; font-style: italic;">Modern Shi‘i Authors on the Question of the Authenticity of the Text of the Qur’an (19th and 20th Centuries)</span><br />
<b>Rainer Brunner</b>, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris</p>

<p>The question of whether the established text of the Qur’an is authentic has always been a major issue for Shi‘i theologians, as it is claimed in numerous <em>hadith</em>s that the compilers of the text deliberately omitted many allusions and explicit references to the <em>Ahl al-bayt</em> as Prophet Muhammad’s legitimate successors. </p>

<p>In the course of the juristic evolution of Twelver Shi‘ism, after the disappearance of their twelfth imam, this allegation was relegated to the background, but the revival of Akhbari Shi‘ism between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries brought it back to the fore. After the final victory of the Usuli current, the issue seemed to be solved for good when the Iranian scholar Husayn Taqi al-Nuri al-Tabrisi (d. 1902) composed the <em>Fasl al-khitab</em>, a lengthy book in which he compiled all known references to the classical conviction of the falsification (<em>tahrif</em>) of the Qur’an. </p>

<p>Since then, the topic has figured prominently in (mostly polemical) debates between Sunnis and Shi‘is, and many modern Twelver Shi‘i writers deem it necessary to include explicit refutations of the classical Twelver doctrine in this regard. Most Qur’anic commentaries refer to it, and, more often than not, the question of <em>tahrif</em> proper is combined with other controversial theological issues, such as abrogation (<em>naskh</em>) or the changing will of God (<em>bada</em>).</p>

<b>Todd Lawson</b>, University of Toronto, Canada</p>

<p>If the literary activity of the virtuosi of the Islamic spiritual and mystical tradition is any guide to go by, then it could be said that a kind of World Wide Web has existed for quite a long time. This paper demonstrates how a self-styled <em>tafsir</em> on the twelfth sura of the Qur’an is in simultaneous conversation with numerous other sacred texts and commentaries. Treating significant words and clusters as ‘hot links’ we are able to plumb the commentarial gesture for the astonishing depth and mastery it reveals, and conceals.</p>


<p><span style="color: #11329E; font-weight:bold; font-style: italic;">The Qur’an and Contemporary Iranian Shi‘i Discourse on the Origins of Language</span><br />
<b>Aun Hasan Ali</b>, McGill University, Canada</p>

<p>This paper deals with contemporary Twelver Shi‘i discourse on the origins of language. It explores how two contemporary Twelver Shi‘i scholars treat the question of the origins of language in different disciplines. The first scholar under consideration is Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, whose main contribution to the tradition lies in the field of <em>usul al-fiqh</em> (the principles of jurisprudence). The second scholar is Mohammad Hosayn Tabataba’i, whose main contributions to the tradition lie in the fields of <em>hikma</em> (philosophy) and <em>tafsir</em> (Qur’anic exegesis).</p>

<p>Sadr treats the question of the origins of language in his textbook on <em>usul al-fiqh</em> entitled <em>Durus fi ‘ilm al-usul</em>, and Tabataba’i treats it in his voluminous exegesis of the Qur’an entitled <em>al-Mizan fi <em>tafsir</em> al-Qur’an</em>. The parameters of <em>tafsir</em> and, to some extent, even its content, are determined by <em>‘ilm usul al-fiqh</em>. The paper concludes that the relationship between these two disciplines shows that <em>‘ilm usul al-fiqh</em> is a foundational discipline and raises the spectre of nomocentrism. </p>

<p>However, as this paper’s presentation of Sadr’s discussion of the origin of language shows, simply because <em>‘ilm usul al-fiqh</em> is seen to serve the law does not mean that it is purely about the law. With regard to <em>tafsir</em>, many contemporary Iranian Reformers, having embraced the modern category of ‘religion’, stress the centrality of a proper understanding of the Qur’an to a true understanding of Islam. They assume that the fact that the Qur’an is the most sacred Islamic text means that disciplines ancillary to it are foundational. The objective of <em>tafsir</em> is to understand the Qur’an, which partly explains the energy that contemporary Iranian Reformers have poured into its interpretation. </p>

<p>This paper, however, shows that <em>tafsir</em> is in reality a second-order endeavour, carried out in a discursive realm which <em>‘ilm usul al-fiqh</em> inscribes.</p>


<p><span style="color: #11329E; font-weight:bold; font-style: italic;">Nusrat Amin (1886–1983) on Gender and Family Relations</span><br />
<b>Maryam Rutner</b>, New York University</p>

<p>In a meta-textual analysis, this paper examines the interpretation of Qur’anic verses related to gender relations in the fifteen-volume <em>tafsir</em> entitled <em><em>Makhzan al-‘irfan dar ‘ulum-i Qur’an</em></em> by Nusrat Amin (1886–1983), a leading <em>mujtahida</em> in twentieth-century Iran. </p>

<p>The paper offers two major insights. First, it shows the <em>mujtahida</em>’s contribution to the larger body of exegetical works by comparing the interpretation of selected verses in <em>Makhzan al-‘irfan</em> to the interpretation of the same verses in other <em>tafsir</em>s. Second, the paper sheds light on Amin’s viewpoints about gender relations by drawing on three sets of literature. </p>

<p>On the one hand, relevant sections in Amin’s other scholarly and non-scholarly works will be analysed. Of special interest here is her non-scholarly book <em>Rawish-i khushbakhti wa tawsiyya ba khaharan-i imani</em>, which she dedicated to the general female readership. On the other hand, the paper will compare her viewpoints about gender relations to those of other contemporary scholars and ‘<em>ulama</em>’ during the Pahlavi era, especially to those of Murtada Mutahhari. </p>

<p>Lastly, the paper puts Amin’s arguments and Qur’anic interpretations on gender relations into the larger context of the literature that is concerned with female religious authorities and women/gender and the Qur’an.</p>


<p><span style="color: #11329E; font-weight:bold; font-style: italic;">The Qur’an and the Rethinking of Tradition in Post-Revolutionary Iran</span><br />
<b>Liyakat Takim</b>, McMaster University, Canada</p>

<p>After the establishment of the Islamic Republic in Iran in 1979, many Twelver Shi‘i scholars started to examine the hermeneutical strategies of the Qur’an. This is because, for the first time, Shi‘i jurists had to respond to the practical needs of a modern state. Some of those scholars have argued that what is essential to a proper understanding of Islam is not the letter of the text but instead the spirit of the Qur’an and the Prophetic traditions. They maintain that there is no single valid interpretation of the Qur’an. </p>
	
<p>Jurists who argue for the reformulation of Islamic laws maintain that the interpretations of Islamic revelation were interwoven with the specificity of past circumstances. Jurists can only pronounce general principles, not rulings that are to be enforced at all times and places. They also argue that hermeneutical principles allow for a different understanding of the Islamic message. For the reform-minded jurists, it is essential that Muslims continue to review and revise the law in keeping with the dictates of their changing circumstances. </p>

<p>Scholars like Ayatollah Sana’i, Ayatollah Jannati, Ayatollah Mohaghegh Damad, Hujjat al-Islam, Muhsin Sa‘idzadeh and Mohsen Kadivar have called for a re-evaluation of traditional juridical pronouncements on many issues. As a matter of fact, discussions with some <em>marja</em>’s can reveal a distinct silent revolution within the seminaries in Qum. </p>

<p>This paper will examine the reinterpretation of Qur’anic laws in the seminaries in Iran. These include calls for reformulation on the <em>hudud</em> punishments (especially the punishment of stoning), women’s rights on the guardianship (<em>wilaya</em>) of minors and women’s rights to unilateral divorce. </p>

<p>In issuing juridical edicts, jurists have resorted to the ethical undertones of the Qur’an and shown a dissonance between the Qur’anic ethos and later juridical formulations that were premised primarily on <em>hadith</em>. The paper will also include observations on recent Qur’anic interpretations based on Liyakat Takim’s research undertaken in summer 2011.</p>


<p><span style="color: #11329E; font-weight:bold; font-style: italic;">Reading the Qur’an through Gender Lenses: A Contribution to a Gendered Ijtihad as Reflected in Iranian Women’s Journals</span><br />
<b>Anna Vanzan</b>, Libera Università di Lingue e Comunicazione (IULM), Milan</p>

<p>Re-reading the Qur’an ‘as a woman’ is pivotal in the campaign by ‘Islamic feminists’ to defy the, so far, prevalent misogynistic and patriarchal interpretations of the holy text. In these last decades, much attention has been given to the revolutionary hermeneutic applied by Amina Wadud, an Afro-American convert who mainly operates in a non-Islamic society and who writes in English. 
However, insufficient attention has been paid to the reinterpreting methods applied by Iranian women in their context, i.e., in the frame of the Islamic Republic whose leadership claims to be the only repository of Qur’anic wisdom. </p>

<p>In Revolutionary Iran, some female theologians involved in a female-centred reading of the Qur’an have been sharing their endeavours with the lay public by publishing them in journals such as <em>Payam-i Hajjari, Zanan, Pazhuhish-i zanan, Farzana</em> and <em>Nafa</em>. Far from being elitist publications addressed to an exclusive academic/specialist milieu, these publications contributed to the widespread new awareness among Iranian women (and men) of the need for a <em>nuwandish-i din</em>, a new religious thinking capable of conciliating faith with human rights, pluralism and rationality.</p>

<p>By creating an open forum for discussing issues traditionally monopolised by the ‘<em>ulama</em>’, Iranian female periodicals not only favoured a gender-sensitive approach to the Qur’an, but also increased a general need and willingness to approach the holy text for a new and more responsible reading.</p>

<p>The first part of the paper considers the major issues of the ‘gendered-debate’ on Qur’anic verses as articulated in the major women’s magazines published in Iran. The second part updates the discussion on the topic by presenting opnions of Iranian female theologians, based on interviews conducted by Anna Vanzan over the last two years.    </p>
