            <h2 class="expand">Message to the participants</h2>
            <div class="collapse">
                <p>The purpose of The Summer Programme on Islam is to provide participants with a social, cultural and civilisational introduction to Islam as well as to situate the Ismaili tariqah within the larger Shi‘i and Sunni contexts of the intellectual and historical development of Islam.</p> 
<p>One of the main objectives of the Summer Programme on Islam is to raise questions, stimulate reflection and encourage discussion on contemporary issues facing Muslim societies. In order to achieve this and for the Programme to be an enjoyable and stimulating experience both for participants and faculty members, it is extremely important that all participants are well-prepared for the sessions. This means that participants should have completed the readings set in advance of their arrival in Cambridge having read actively, and with a critical and engaged mind. </p>
<p>Participants should come to each session with questions, either about specific ideas in the readings or about the topic more generally. The faculty will expect them to have a good understanding of the content of the readings that have been set. The organisers are aware that entrants to the Programme are coming from diverse academic and professional backgrounds and therefore may be encountering much of this information for the first time. The important thing is that each participant gives themselves enough time to work through the readings at their own pace before arriving in Cambridge. When participants arrive, they should all feel reasonably comfortable with the material set in advance so that in the sessions all participants can truly engage with the perspectives and learning which the faculty have to offer.</p>
<p>To complement the academic sessions, participants can look forward to many other activities that will enable them to get to know their fellow participants and to explore the beautiful city of Cambridge. The Programme this year will be held in the beautiful and historic environment of Lucy Cavendish College, which is located in Cambridge.</p>

<p>If there are any queries, please do not hesitate to get in touch with us.</p>

<p>We wish you a safe journey and look forward to meeting you in the next few weeks time.</p>
