            <div class="collapse">
<p>The Qur’an is a central reference for various levels of public discourse in Iran. As the founding
scripture of Islam, it influences the expression of all aspects of the life of
Muslims, be it religious, cultural or social. Its interpretation, in the form
of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tafsir</i> or in other genres and
fields, establishes the boundaries of religious identity of each denomination;
informs its religious outlook and practice; and shapes the character of each
individual’s relationship with the divine and within society.</p>

<p>In Iran, where the majority of
the population adheres to <a href="../../iis.ac.uk/GlossaryItem0f94.html?GlossaryID=220" target="_blank"><u>Twelver Shi‘ism</u></a>, the relationship between the
Qur’an and society is charged with a set of peculiarities that have not been
investigated comprehensively and in detail by specialists in Iranian or Qur’anic
studies. For example, until recently, the Qur’an was given relatively less
attention in the Twelver Shi‘i institutions of religious learning than in most
Sunni <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>madrasa</i>s.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Qur’an
has had an impact on many areas of Iranian society and culture: its script has
been creatively seen as inspiration for the arts; its meaning has been employed
by rival factions in political discourse; its depths have been explored by the
mystics of every persuasion and its symbols have never ceased to permeate and
influence, by devotion or by reaction, almost every kind of literary expression
in the Persian language.</p>

<p>From the much debated issue of
the canonical text to the revival of Qur’anic studies in post-revolutionary
Iran, the Qur’an has been extensively read, revered, interpreted and translated
in contemporary Iran. Furthermore, it has been used as a source of inspiration,
carried as a banner, instrumentally used by politicians, turned into a
manifesto for the oppressed, and even critiqued.</p>

<p>By bringing together specialists
in early modern and contemporary Iran from various disciplines, ranging from
Islamic studies to the social sciences, the main aim of the project is to draw
as comprehensive as possible a picture of the various approaches to the Qur’an
that have been adopted in contemporary Iran.</p>

<p>The panel and wider project focuses on the past 150 years, from the second half of the nineteenth century,
when the intellectual drive that would breed the constitutional uprising was at
its height, to the first decade of the twenty-first century, where Iran is one
of the key arenas of religious, intellectual, political and social debate in
the world.</p>
<p>The project will culminate in a peer-reviewed edited volume of articles selected from the colloquium and
panels, which will be submitted to the <a href="../../iis.ac.uk/view_article2212.html?ContentID=110973" target="_blank"><u>Qur’anic Studies Series</u></a>,
published by Oxford University Press in association with The Institute of
Ismaili Studies.</p>

<p>This is part of a wider ‘Regional Approaches’ project at the Institute’s Qur’anic Studies Unit
which is committed to exploring the reception of the Qur’an in various regions
in the contemporary Muslim world. Other projects have included, or will
include, Indonesia, <a href="../../iis.ac.uk/view_article8327.html?ContentID=112477" target="_blank"><u>Sub-Saharan Africa</u></a>, Turkey, the Maghreb,
South Asia, Central Asia and the Arab Middle East.
