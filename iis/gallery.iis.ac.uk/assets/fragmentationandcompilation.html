            <div class="collapse">
<p>This workshop is the sequel to the one organised in 2012, entitled Fragmentation and Compilation: The Making of Religious Texts in Islam. A Comparison with Ancient Mesopotamia, Judaism and Christianity, which focused on the problematic of fragmentation and compilation from a multi-disciplinary perspective, with specialists in Mesopotamian texts, Islam, Judaism and Christianity making contributions. In these workshops, fragmentation and compilation are approached as textual phenomena which cannot be divorced from the objective structure of the text or from its intrinsic argumentative dimension, that is, the specific claims that are either explicitly made by, or implicitly embedded within, the text. Fragmentation and compilation are also viewed as hermeneutical experiences manifested by various techniques of citation, selection and canonisation, in one word: interpretation. The comparative perspective will address more the methodological tools than the specificities of the history of each discipline represented in the workshop..</p>

<p>The second part of the workshop addresses the same problematic of fragmentation and compilation with a more focused view on techniques of citation, repetition, variation selection and canonisation of religious texts in early and classical Islam with an opening perspective on Biblical studies. It is also dedicated to the application of some of the key concepts raised in the first workshop and extends into a multi-disciplinary discussion including the fields of hadith studies and Islamic epigraphy.</p>

<p>The workshop includes participants from various fields, including Professor Frederic Imbert, an expert on early Islamic epigraphy and the writing of sacred texts on stones, and Dr Holger Zellentin and Dr Mehdi Azaiez, experts in Biblical studies, who will focus on the Qur’anic reception and recasting of Biblical texts. Dr Asma Hilali will look at the concept of Qur’anic variants and Dr Stephen Burge will examine the problematic of fragmentation/compilation within the arba‘un collections of traditions (collections of forty hadith).</p>

<p>Professor Aziz Al-Azmeh, a participant in the first workshop, will be the discussant of the first open session dedicated to the current challenges facing the field of Qur’anic studies. Three select aspects will be covered:</p>

<p>(i) Qur’anic manuscripts: A tool or an aim?</p>

<p>(ii) Intertextuality: Methodological remarks.</p>

<p>(iii) Fragmentation/compilation perspectives on the Qur’an text in the context of the history of its transmission.</p>
