<P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG></P>
<P>After surveying what is known of Qur&#8217;anic exegesis in different regions of Africa, this paper will present the findings of field research concerning several languages, especially Manding (Bamana, Maninka, Mandinka, and Dyula speech forms), carried out primarily in Mali but also in Guinea and The Gambia. In these areas, the entire Qur&#8217;an is read aloud, orally rendered into and commented upon in the local language, in two contexts: for a wide audience, in the month of Ramadan; as a subject of the advanced curriculum, in traditional forms of Islamic education. Brief passages may also be cited and commented upon in the Friday sermon, in public preaching, and in the <I>madrasa</I> (modernising Islamic schools). In accordance with what appears to be a general practice in West Africa, the Arabic text is parsed into syntactical units, then translated &#8211; unit by unit &#8211; into the local language. Analysis, which will be extensively illustrated by Manding oral commentaries collected in the field, will focus on: their basis in Arabic written texts; Qur&#8217;an reading and recitation styles; the specialised vocabulary created by scholars (usually from Manding roots) to express religious concepts; specific syntactical features of scholarly discourse; and stylistic and rhetorical features.</P>

<P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG></P>
<P>The annotated Qur&#8217;an manuscripts written in the seventeenth to eighteenth centuries by the scribes of the Borno Sultanate represent a unique corpus of <I>tafasir</I> in Arabic and Old Kanembu &#8211; a Saharan language that was used for Qur&#8217;anic interpretation at that time. These bilingual annotations provide direct evidence for the intensive study of <I>tafsir</I> at a time when Borno was at the height of its political power and religious influence in the region. The paper is organised as follows. Section 1 provides a description of the digital collection of the Borno Qur&#8217;an manuscripts. Section 2 discusses a wide variety of commentaries in Arabic both well known (totalling twelve identified <I>tafasir</I>) and unidentified (seven titles and three authors). Section 3 introduces commentary to the Qur&#8217;an in Old Kanembu and in the language known locally as &#8216;Tarjumo&#8217;, a descendant of Old Kanembu. Tarjumo functions synchronically only as a language of commentary on texts written and read in Arabic. It is unintelligible to the speakers of modern Kanembu and its sister language Kanuri and can only be understood by people who have received special education. Section 4, finally, addresses the relation between the commentaries in Arabic and Old Kanembu/Tarjumo.<B></B></P>

<P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG></P>
<P>Since the early 1990s in Niger a state-controlled, ostensibly monolithic Islamic tradition has evolved into multiple modes of Muslim religiosity, some of which actively denounce the secularism of the state and the erosion of religious values. The spread of reformist Islam contributed to the hardening of doctrinal differences and the sharpening of religious identities, sparking intense debates over the correct practice of Islam. Prayer has been the object of particularly virulent debate between rival religious factions. Because of how it sets the tempo of daily life in Muslim communities, prayer is synonymous with Islam in Niger. Whether or not they perform the five daily prayers, Muslims are referred to as &#8216;those who pray&#8217;. In communal prayer, the faithful publicise their fellowship and unity. </P>
<P>Distinctions or deviations in styles of worship which may prove acceptable in private, inevitably become declarations of specific religious orientations. As visible expressions of religious membership, they also become part of struggles for the control of public space. Adeline Masquelier will explore the contentious debates surrounding worship that took place in the provincial town of Dogondoutchi, highlighting how liturgical issues, themselves an index of cleavages emerging within society, provided an effective means through which Muslims reinvented themselves as custodians of endangered Islamic values. Although so-called traditionalist Muslims were compelled to articulate cogently their interpretation of the Qur&#8217;anic scripture in the face of Muslim reformists&#8217; criticisms, they continued to rely on the legitimising weight of tradition and the value of commonsense to justify particular ritual conducts. </P>

<P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG></P>
<P>The re-emergence and rapid expansion of Salafism from the early 1990s has transformed and reconfigured the religious landscape in a number of localities in Ethiopia. One of these localities is Bale, an Oromo area, a stronghold for Salafism, and the focus for this paper. Largely apolitical in character, the Salafi movement in Bale has been overly concerned with existing religious practices, and has arduously attacked pilgrimages to local shrines, the celebration of <I>mawlid al-Nabi, </I>and has in general sought to cleanse Islam from any traits of Oromo cultural elements, considered as unlawful. Underscoring the role of Islamic scripture as the sole authority for enjoining what is right and condemning what is wrong, the Salafis have brought a more cognitive approach to texts, challenging earlier &#8216;magical&#8217; understandings and usages of scriptures as talismans and amulets with curative powers. The Word, the Salafis claim, is the only legitimate guide for religious purity, and must hence be read and understood.</P>
<P>Although religious changes have been extensive and highly visible, there are, not surprisingly, certain degrees of continuity from earlier conceptions. This paper seeks to move beyond oft-used dichotomies which position recent Islamic reformism as disconnected from the past which it seeks to correct, as &#8220;alien&#8221; to the African context, and addresses the complexity of appropriation and accommodation of impetuses for change. The point of departure for the paper is a story Terje &#216;steb&#248; collected during fieldwork (2005-2007) in Bale, called &#8220;The revenge of the <I>jinn&#8221;. </I></P>
<P>The story is about a group of <I>jinn, </I>frustrated over the decrease of offerings brought to them, taking revenge upon the people. Through a detailed analysis of the story, the aim is to discuss the alterations brought by the Salafis &#8211; with a focus on the complexity of continuity and change. Terje &#216;steb&#248; hopes to demonstrate that although earlier conceptions of Islam were challenged, many of the localised perceptions of spiritual forces remained relevant among the reformists. Focusing on the context of the text, &#216;steb&#248; will discuss how a changed approach to Islamic scripture &#8211; with a more clear-cut emphasis on the actual content and meaning of texts &#8211; has been decisive for the process of change, at the same time, demonstrating how this approach is being accommodated to the locality of Bale. Terje &#216;steb&#248;<B> </B>hopes to enhance our understanding of contemporary Islamic reformism as inherently connected to the dynamic character of Islam in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>

<P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG></P>
<P>This paper will examine the Qur&#8217;anic and other textual content written on a talismanic shirt from the early 20th<SUP> </SUP>century Burkina Faso (T91.0091) now in the Textile Museum of Canada. The aim of this study is to understand the Qur&#8217;anic text used on this shirt in relation to similar texts found on talismanic shirts from West Africa, as well as other Muslim contexts, including the esoteric use of the &#8216;99 names of Allah&#8217;. Ruba Kana&#8217;an will argue that while expressed in a local idiom, talismanic shirts and the use of Qur&#8217;anic text as a talisman, is a common practice that can be found throughout the Muslim world in different historical periods. </P>
<P>More particularly, the paper will consider the way in which the Qur&#8217;anic and other textual materials on the shirt inform us about the various amuletic uses of the Qur&#8217;an in Muslim contexts as well as the theological rationales and the diverse juridical arguments that are often used to support or prohibit such practices. It also problematises the manner in which these talismanic shirts tend to be interpreted as &#8216;folk&#8217;, &#8216;syncretistic&#8217;, or &#8216;heterodox&#8217; expressions of Islam, in contrast to notions of &#8216;high&#8217;, &#8216;pure&#8217; and &#8216;orthodox&#8217; practice. Such arguments are particularly germane to the study of Islam in Africa. </P>

<P><I>The Patterned Imagination</I> will examine certain non-figurative repeat patterns in order to better understand their unique role in the production of cultural meanings. The specific focus will be on a constellation of patterns that emerge from magic squares, especially as they appear on West African textiles in an Islamic context. Magic squares are represented, both explicitly and implicitly in patterns, on many Islamic West African textiles as talismans with the power to effect protection and healing for the wearer. Since the textiles under study are encountered at the Textile Museum of Canada, the British Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Patricia Bentley poses the question, &#8216;how has the meaning of their patterns changed through their move from their originating space into an institutional space, whether physical (museum) or virtual (photo, cinema, Web-based representation or academic discourse)&#8217;?<B></B></P>

<P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG></P>
<P>If there is a Muslim visual culture, a particular way of seeing in Muslim West African societies, what is the place of photography in these visual worlds? In this presentation Beth Buggenhagen will analyse the visual manifestations of trans-local trade circuits organised under the aegis of Tariqa Murid. The Murid way emerged in Senegal at the turn of the 20th century as an agrarian movement seeking autonomy from French colonial rule. Today, the vast majority of Murid men and women engage in global trade networks. As Murid traders weave cargo and currency through official and unofficial spaces of the global economy, challenging regulatory authorities along the way, they also circulate the media of social production along these same routes: religious texts and images, cloth, and photographs and videos/DVDs of life cycle ceremonies. </P>
<P>Buggenhagen will consider the &#8216;visual practice&#8217; (Roberts and Roberts 2003) of matrimonial photography in trans-local Murid households. These portraits, along with other forms of value such as cloth and objects of adornment, circulate in a visual economy concerned with hierarchy and rank based on a beautiful birth (<I>rafet-u-juddo</I>), which manifests itself as honour and wealth. These images capture outer beauty (<I>sanse</I>) and project inner grace (<I>baraka</I>) by drawing on the tension between <I>zahir</I>, the visible, and <I>batin</I>, the invisible prevalent in Sufi thought. </P>
<P>Buggenhagen<B> </B>hopes to answer a number of questions such as how and when are objects of wealth made visible through dress, display, and bestowal, and at what points are they concealed or withheld from circulation? As forms of display and concealment, how do portraits work the contradictory forces of conservation and change, of the seen and the unseen, and the pleasures and pressures of give and take? And how do these images enable women to keep something back from the pressure to give (Weiner 1992)? How does the historic shift in portrait photography from capturing the <I>jikko</I>, or essence of the person, to multiplying surfaces (Pinney 2001, Buckly 2000), or ways of seeing the image, relate to wider structural transformations in Murid social worlds. To answer these questions she will focus on the production, circulation and reception of these visual objects to understand how processes of social production unfold in contexts of transnational migration marked by political uncertainty and fiscal turbulence.</P>

<P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG></P>
<P>This presentation will explore the connections between gender, altered states, and cultural representations of Islam. The focus is upon &#8216;battles&#8217; between spiritual beings, namely, the soul (<I>iman</I>), ancestors (<I>Kel Arou</I> or <I>Kel Nad</I>), spirits mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an (<I>djinn</I> or <I>djinnoun</I>), and the &#8216;spirits of the wild&#8217; (<I>Kel Essuf</I>) among the Tuareg (<I>Kel Tamajaq</I>) of rural Niger, West Africa, as illustrated in a case study: a woman&#8217;s dream, her consultations with an Islamic scholar/diviner, his prescribed ritual, and the spiritual and social outcomes of these processes in a semi-nomadic, Muslim, socially stratified rural community of Tamajaq-speaking Tuareg in the rural Air Mountains. </P>
<P>The first portion of the paper presents a critical overview of anthropological studies of two kinds of altered states spirit possession and dreams, and argues for integrating them to reveal additional aspects of their connections to religion and gender. There is an emphasis upon works from Muslim communities in Africa. The next portion of the paper analyses the central question: of why this woman, who dreamed of a spiritual being diagnosed as the soul of her deceased husband who had died far from home, did not follow another path frequently followed by persons who experience nostalgia, solitude, or &#8216;the wild&#8217; (<I>essuf</I>) in Tuareg society: namely, possession by the Kel Essuf spirits of the wild, solitude, and nostalgia, followed by exorcism in some cases, or by a pact with the spirits conferring divining powers in other cases (Rasmussen 1995, 2001, 2006). </P>
<P>The analysis explores similarities and differences between concepts of spirits, ancestors, and souls in Tuareg cosmology and philosophy, which derive from Islam and also pre-date it. The analysis also examines key players who shape the interpretation of spiritual beings and influence their impact: namely, medico-ritual specialists whom many Tuareg consult for non-organic and other illnesses, who include male Islamic scholars and female medicine women. </P>
<P>Rasmussen will explore the ways in which the dreamer/patient and healer understand themselves and dreams, as well as altered states in relation to gendered religious authority and knowledge. She hopes to highlight this in a society where many women enjoy high social prestige and independent property ownership, but also struggle over changing gender relations, and negotiate over Qur&#8217;anic and local cultural interpretations of Islam that are both flexible and interwoven but also contradictory and competing. </P>
<P>The data suggest finer nuances than rigid binary oppositions in differences between &#8216;official/organised&#8217; scriptural and textual religions and so-called &#8216;popular&#8217; or &#8216;indigenous&#8217; religions, and suggest alternatives to interpreting altered states as either solely resistance or solely accommodation. More broadly, the essay explores the connections between gender, altered states of dreams and possession/mediumship, and circulating religious authority and knowledge (Crapanzano 1973, 1992; Lohmann 2003), in terms of overlaps, accommodations, and dissonance between Islam and local cultural interpretations of Islam (Boddy 1989; Masquelier 2001; McIntosh 2004, 2009; Rasmussen 1995, 2001, 2006).<B></B></P>

<P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG></P>
<P>This paper will explore how the words of the Qur&#8217;an, are understood and practiced as medication, <I>dawa</I>, among so-called ordinary women and men in Zanzibar Town. Thus the paper focuses uses of the Qur&#8217;an in both ritual and social life. The presence and evocation of the Qur&#8217;an induces a ritual context, however the Book and its rehearsed words also form part of the more mundane settings of everyday-life. Kjersti Larson<B> </B>will critically examine how the Qur&#8217;an combines and conflates what is often denoted as a distinction between a ritual and social space. A common Zanzibari approach to the Qur&#8217;an, its meaning, materiality and properties, mirror, one the one hand, a particular understanding of how the religious may easily conflate with what is usually seen as the social, moral and political fields. </P>
<P>On the other hand, a Zanzibari use and understanding of the Qur&#8217;an is constantly bringing to the fore specific socio-cultural values in all their complexity. Following from this, my aim is thus to argue how the Qur&#8217;an as it is practiced and understood in Zanzibar, both reflects and generates a society where the religious is social and the social is religious and where human religious authority remains fluid and rather difficult to delimit, mark and embody over time as well as across spatial boundaries.</P>
<P>The discussion will be grounded in data collected through social anthropological fieldwork conducted in Zanzibar from 1984 until present, focussing on particular ethnographic cases both questioning and illustrating how the Qur&#8217;an may be involved when emotional and mundane matters are investigated and sometimes, solved in this particular society along the East African coast. </P>

<P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG></P>
<P>On a spring morning in 1921, Shaykh Abdullahi al-Qutbi led a string of camels out of the coastal town of Berbera and into the Somali interior. Rather than loaded with trade goods, his pack animals were carrying copies of his latest work, <I>al-Majmu&#8217;a al-Mubaraka</I>&#8212;<I>The Blessed Collection</I>. The <I>Majmu&#8217;a</I> was a compilation of pamphlets that ranged across a number of subjects from diatribes against his own Qadiriyya order&#8217;s perceived enemies the Salihiyya to instruction on attaining the path to annihilation of the self in the presence of God. Within its pages, however, a surprising amount of space is devoted to what at first might seem far more mundane subjects. </P>
<P>These include rudimentary instruction in the Five Pillars of the faith, proper prayer ritual and social etiquette, advice on writing contracts that were legal within the parameters of Islamic law, and guidance in distinguishing the permitted (<I>halal</I>) from the forbidden (<I>haram</I>) in every day life. The treatment of topics that would have been routine to most Muslims in a work of esoteric knowledge was no accident. Their inclusion was part of al-Qutbi&#8217;s mission to spread not only the teachings of his Qadiriyya order into the Somali hinterland, but also to extend the reach of &#8216;orthodox&#8217; knowledge into what many considered the furthest reaches of the Islamic frontier &#8211; a place where herders and agriculturalists might call themselves Muslim but where the teachings of the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunna were often only vaguely recognized.</P>
<P>The 20th century is regarded by many as a period in which scripturalist and modernist reformers increasingly dominated Muslim public discourse. Utilising the printing press and new means of communication such as steam travel and the telegraph, reformists were able to disseminate their teachings further and faster than ever before. However, as the example of Shaykh Abdullahi demonstrates, they were not the only ones to use these new technologies to transmit particular visions of the faith. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries Sufi Shaykhs such as al-Qutbi spread their teachings throughout the Somali interior. While seeking to propagate the esoteric teachings of Islamic mysticism, individuals like al-Qutbi were also concerned with more basic beliefs among the peoples of the interior. </P>
<P>In their estimation, superstition and local custom dominated rural society while the most basic teachings of the Holy Book were often unknown. They sought to remedy this deficiency by distributing works such as the <I>Majmu&#8217;a</I> to Qur&#8217;anic teachers in villages and hamlets in the hope of spreading what they viewed as a more proper faith. A close reading of the mystical literature produced in Somali before the middle of the last century indicates that the <I>Majmu&#8217;a al-Mubaraka</I> was hardly an anomaly. Printed hagiographies and collections of mystical poetry provided similar guidance to the faithful on how to follow a path derived from the teachings of the holy scriptures. Utilising these and other sources, this paper examines the efforts of Somali Sufis to bring the lessons of these texts to their brethren in the hope of truly extending the boundaries of the faith and banishing the dark shadows of superstition through the light of the Holy Qur&#8217;an and the Sunna of God&#8217;s Prophet.</P>

<P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG></P>
<P>The focus of this presentation will be the history of some West African <I>ulama</I> who decided to emigrate (i.e., to perform a <I>hijra</I>) from their homeland when they had lost their <I>jihad</I> against European colonial armies. They decided to escape Christian rule and to move into the heartland of the Islamic world &#8211; the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Instead of a temporary exile, which is normally the meaning of <I>hijra</I>, they settled there permanently. By means of a description of the<I> hijra</I> route and the presentation of some biographical notes of these<I> ulama</I>, the first aim of the presentation is to show how the fates and the life stories of these African elites were closely related to the colonial history of West Africa. </P>
<P>This migration&#8217;s history, namely, the emigration of Muslims from West Africa to Sudan, and then to Mecca and Medina, as a result of the European colonization, represents an aspect of the colonial history in Africa that has been neglected despite its importance. The second aim of the presentation is to show the contribution of these West African <I>ulama</I> to the education system of Saudi Arabia and in the propagation of the <I>wahhabiyya</I> doctrine inside and outside Saudi Arabia, especially in West Africa. At the methodological level, the question explored will be about the connection between biographies and social structures.</P>

<P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG></P>
<P>The considerable literature on the history and social organisation of Sufi Islamic groups in West Africa has focussed almost entirely on highly visible male leaders and their political implications. Researchers&#8217; biases have conspired with local gender practices to obscure women&#8217;s, sometimes decisive, exercise of religious authority. This paper discusses several daughters of the Tijani Sufi shaykh, Ibrahim Nas, in Senegal who act as Islamic leaders and teachers. While these women are widely recognised as Qur&#8217;an teachers, internationally influential Islamic authorities, and channels of their father&#8217;s divine blessing (<EM>baraka</EM>), their formal appointment as Sufi spiritual guides who regularly induct male and female disciples into the Sufi order is far less widely known.</P>
<P>In exercising and justifying their religious leadership, these women both utilise and undermine conventional attitudes toward proper Muslim women&#8217;s piety and social roles. On the one hand, they present their teaching and leadership roles merely as natural variations on their roles as mothers and keepers of the home. </P>
<P>Furthermore, they associate the interior dispositions expected of pious Muslim women with the inner nature of the mystical knowledge that is central to this Sufi movement&#8217;s growth. Yet on the other hand, they appeal to Sufi doctrines seeking the transcendence of all distinctions to argue that gender distinctions are illusory. Yet rather than eliminate gender categories, they follow Sufi texts in claiming that, in a mystical sense, a spiritually advanced woman is a man.</P>
<P>Operating largely from within their own bedrooms, the daughters of Shaykh Ibrahim Nas significantly shape this Islamic movement&#8217;s operation within Senegal and its globalization. This paper discusses several of these daughters, focusing especially on two of the best known, Sayyida Mariyama Nas and Sayyida Roqiya Nas. Both run multiple Islamic schools, have a powerful voice in the community&#8217;s operation in Senegal, have a significant following in other West African countries, and are known even in the Middle East as religious authorities. </P>
<P>Sayyida Mariyama was recently interviewed on Al Jazeera and described how she had acted as an envoy of the Senegalese government to Middle Eastern countries. Both are most famous for teaching the Qur&#8217;an, which is not only God&#8217;s word but is part of nearly every Senegalese Muslim&#8217;s childhood and by extension can be associated with maternal nurturing. Because these elder children of Shaykh Ibrahim Nas appear in public meetings far less often than their brothers and do not bear certain formal titles that only men bear (such as &#8216;Khalifa&#8217;), they are easily overlooked as leaders; yet younger brothers defer to their seniority. Sayyida Mariyama Nas, for example, is sometimes treated as the senior representative of the Sufi group in Dakar even though her younger brother bears the title of &#8216;Khalifa&#8217; there. </P>
<P>Paradoxically, in this Sufi context where forms of truth and authority presented as &#8216;hidden&#8217; are often viewed as the highest and most legitimate, the hidden nature of these women&#8217;s authority often serves to heighten their prestige and perceived piety.<B></B></P>

<P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG></P>
<P>In East Africa, as well as in other parts of the Muslim world, reference to the Qur&#8217;an unifies Muslims as a religious community as much as it separates different Muslim groups from each other. Differences in the interpretation of the universally identical text (in classical Arabic) matter here, and indeed make all the difference between competing schools of Islamic thought and their followers. This can be seen in local Islamic texts as well as in the conduct of and communication among Muslims. Competing interpretations of the Qur&#8217;an (or common assumptions about this) shape an underlying basis for arguments and discussions that we can observe in publications and everyday life &#8211; in this case in East Africa, and specifically the Swahili coast and Mombasa as a regional publishing centre. Depending on context and circumstance, such differences may be left implicit or they may be picked up on and emphasised (e.g., for rhetorical reasons). </P>
<P>Drawing from long-term anthropological research in Mombasa and textual research on Islamic pamphlets, books and newspapers in Kiswahili, I will focus mainly on two prominent local publications, and read and contextualise them with a view to such dynamics. </P>
<P>The first one, <I>Uwongozi</I> (Guidance), was first published in 1944 during the British colonial era and is a selection of brief scholarly and social commentaries addressing the Muslim community of the early 1930s, by Sheikh Al-Amin Mazrui (1891-1947), the initiator of modern Islamic reform in East Africa. The second, <I>Sauti ya Haki</I> (Voice of Justice), is an Islamic newspaper quarterly published between 1972 and 1982 by his student and prot&#233;g&#233;e Sheikh Muhammad Kasim Mazrui (1912-1982). Both writers also began to translate the Qur&#8217;an into Kiswahili &#8211; a project which their student/peer Sheikh Abdalla Saleh Farsy successfully completed in 1969. </P>
<P>Kai Kresse will use these readings as entry-points to illustrate some aspects of internal diversity of Islam in East Africa, and tensions between significant groups of regional Muslims. Kresse believes these can be explored further, with varying emphasis on the role of the Qur&#8217;an itself, keeping the social relationships of Muslims in everyday interaction in mind.</P>

<P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG></P>
<P>This paper will look at the <I>allo </I>(Hausa term for <I>al-lawh</I>), the wooden tablet formerly used throughout the Muslim world for the teaching of the Qur&#8217;an, and still adopted in most traditional West African Qur&#8217;anic schools. The paper focuses on the role of the <I>allo</I> in the first stages of traditional Islamic education in Hausaland (Northern Nigeria) and on the symbolism associated with it. </P>
<P>A special emphasis is placed on discussing the anthropomorphism of the different physical shapes taken by the <I>allo </I>through the different stages of traditional Qur&#8217;anic studies. Far from being a mere substitute of paper as a support of learning before the latter became easily (and cheaply) available in the region, the <I>allo </I>continues to be considered in many of the traditional Islamic schools as the necessary<I> </I>support for writing the Qur&#8217;an in the elementary stages of education. The <I>allo, </I>in fact,<I> </I>is not simply a material tool for writing, but it is an item charged with a complex net of symbolic meanings. The <I>allo</I> allows the student to conceive her/his learning as the re-enactment (and not only the transmission) of the original process of Revelation, of the &#8216;descent&#8217; (<I>nuzul</I>) of the archetypal, eternal Qur&#8217;an from the heavenly &#8216;Preserved Tablet&#8217; (<I>al-Lawh al-mahfuz</I>) to the Prophet Muhammad.</P>

<P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG></P>
<P>In this paper, Ryan Thomas Skinner will examine Islam as a morally steeped and widely deployed discursive resource in the verbal art of urban popular music in Bamako, Mali. His focus will be on the inter-textual and inter-subjective references to Islamic thought and practice in three distinct, though frequently overlapping genres of vocal performance: praise song, rap, and dance band lyricism. Within these genres, Skinner observes how Malian vocalists invoke Islam as a sign of religious ideology to interpellate individual listeners as &#8216;moral subjects,&#8217; taking &#8216;ideology,&#8217; to mean those paradigmatic systems of social and cultural hegemony (such as religion), which prescribe (without wholly determining) modes of identification in society. </P>
<P>Drawing on Althusser&#8217;s notion of &#8216;interpellation&#8217; in which subjects are positioned within ideological systems through the vocal and gestural call-and-response of the hail (&#8220;Hey you!&#8221;), Skinner attends to the specifically, though not exclusively Islamic morality of subjects called forth &#8211; or interpellated &#8211; in live and mediated musical expression. As a politics and poetics of (mis)recognition, he is also interested in the anticipated, though ultimately highly variable, and sometimes totally unforeseen listener responses to Islamic interpellation in Malian popular music, in which listening is understood as a dynamic, structured and structuring practice of ideological subject formation.</P>
<P>Taken together, his three case studies reveal Islam, as an ideological sign of musical interpellation in Bamako, to be a variable and fluid vehicle of moral &#8216;subjectivation&#8217; in the Malian capital. The moral subjects produced by the vocalized &#8216;call&#8217; of Islam in Malian popular music are irreducibly plural, in whom various shades of Islamic morality co-exist with other moralizing ideologies, articulated through, in his studies, ethno-linguistic, generational, political, and commercial, as well as other religious affiliations. Yet, in all cases, the voice of Islam re-sounds as a vital and privileged discursive resource in Bamako popular culture. Through the hybrid musical sign of a common faith, artists and audiences attempt to re-call &#8211; in the form of recurrent interpellating gestures of vocal expression and reception &#8211; their moral subjectivity in what is perceived to be an increasingly immoral world. </P>
<P>Despite the heterogeneity of the &#8216;Islam&#8217; they invoke, this popular musical public produces an aesthetic of moral interpellation that is surprisingly coherent and consistent, from which a locally salient urban <I>Bamakois</I> morality emerges. In all cases, Islamic thought and practice is juxtaposed with other social and cultural signs of moral subjectivity to frame public discourse and ethically orient public selves. Of course, these inter-textual framings and inter-subjective orientations do not always articulate as anticipated, revealing the spectre of (mis)recognition to haunt the very morality that is called into being.</P>

<P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG></P>
<P>The <I>Mamma Haidara Library</I> was started by Abdul Kader Haidara, former employee of the Ahmed Baba Institute (IHERI-AB). After leaving the centre he devoted all of his time and energy to preserve his own family&#8217;s manuscript collection and was successful in setting up the Mamma Haidara Memorial Library, which was the first of its kind in Mali. The Haidara family is renowned for its scholars and judges. Abdul Kader&#8217;s father, Mamma Haidara, was not only a judge (<I>qadi</I>), but also a scholar who taught classical Islamic sciences such as Jurisprudence and Arabic Grammar. His personal library dates back to the 16<SUP>th</SUP> century and is one of the largest and oldest collections in the city. This library was established by Mamma Haidara&#8217;s forebear, Mohamed El Mawlud, and was handed down to his descendents, generation after generation. Mamma Haidara added to it substantially, buying manuscripts while studying in Egypt and Sudan. He also studied under local scholars in the village learning centres of Arawan and Boujbeyha, procuring manuscripts there as well. In addition to his Timbuktu library, Mamma Haidara had also established an archive in the village of Bamba. Mamma Haidara&#8217;s efforts were by no means restricted to the collation and preservation of manuscripts. He also established collaborative relationships with other manuscript libraries in the region, facilitating research and exchange. </P>
<P>When Mamma Haidara died in 1981, he not only left behind a tremendous legacy for his son, Abdul Kader, but also a passion for manuscripts and an education in basic cataloguing and conservation skills.</P>

<P><STRONG>Abstract</STRONG></P>
<P>In 2005, Aluka (since merged with JSTOR) began a dialogue with members of library and scholarly communities, expressing an interest in helping to solve some of the challenges faced by libraries in Timbuktu. In January 2007, Aluka entered into a formal partnership with SAVAMA-DCI (<I>L&#8217;organisation Non Gouvernmentale pour la Sauvegarde et la Valorisation des Manuscrits pour la Defense de la Culture Islamique</I>), a Timbuktu-based NGO whose mission is to help private manuscript libraries in Mali safeguard, preserve, and understand their intellectual treasures. As part of this project, Aluka also partnered with two academic groups, Northwestern University&#8217;s Advanced Media Production Studio (NUIT A&amp;RT NUAMPS), led by Mr. Harlan Wallach, and the Tombouctou Mss Project at the University of Cape Town&#8217;s Department of Historical Studies. This project provided SAVAMA-DCI with the resources to catalogue 600 manuscripts from the Mamma Haidara and Imam Essayouti Libraries in Timbuktu and equipment and training in digitizing 300 of these manuscripts. <BR><BR>Rajan and Wallach&#8217;s presentation will detail the original impetus and vision behind the collaboration as well as the various steps involved in creating a formal collaboration between the core partners. During the course of the project, there were four trips to Timbuktu by the administrative, training, and implementation teams. This timeline involved concurrent development work across two continents on the broad range of components needed to successfully deliver on the project goals. They will also discuss the project&#8217;s implementation, results to date, and finally, concluding remarks about future directions and prospects.</P>

She is the editor (with Anne-Maria Makhulu and Stephen Jackson) of <i>Hard Work, Hard Times: Global Volatility and African Subjectivities</i> (University of California Press, 2010). She is also the author of the forthcoming book, <i>Muslim Families in Global Senegal: Money Takes Care of Shame</i> (Indiana University Press, 2011), which analyzes how Senegalese Murid migrants have circulated cargo and currency through official and unofficial networks globally. <i>Muslim Families in Global Senegal</i> focuses on trade and the transmission of enduring social value though cloth and religious offerings. Highlighting women's participation in these networks and the financial strategies they rely on, Beth Buggenhagen reveals the connections between economic profits and ritual and social authority. These strategies are not responses to a dispersed community in crisis, but rather produce new roles, wealth, and worth for Senegalese women in all parts of the globe.</p>

<p><b><a name="abdel"></a>Abdel Kader Haidara</b></p>
<p>Sheikh Abdel Kader Haidara is heir, director, and curator of the Mamma Haidara Memorial Library at Timbuktu, Mali, which is the largest of 22 private libraries in the City of Timbuktu, and out of the 120 in The Republic of Mali. He is one of Timbuktu&#8216;s leading manuscripts experts, and the son of a renowned local collector, Mamma Haidara. He was 17 when his father died and left the collection in his hands. He was enlisted to collect manuscripts for the newly established Ahmed Baba Institute for Documentation and Research in Timbuktu, the first concerted efforts to save Mali&#8216;s ancient manuscripts that opened in 1970. He was successful in collecting more than 20,000 manuscripts for the Institute. It was later that he was able to raise enough money to open the Mamma Haidara Memorial Library, through the help of Henry Louis Gates, Jr. of Harvard University, who visited Timbuktu in 1996. The Andrew Mellon Foundation and other international friends have enabled the library to construct a new permanent home for its collections, which opened to the public in 2000. Today the library holds over 10,000 ancient manuscripts and many printed books. This family library has been in the Haidara family since before the 16<sup>th</sup> century. Abdel Kader Haidara is the honored guest and keynote speaker for the workshop.</p>

<p><b><a name="joseph"></a>Joseph Hill</b></p>
<p>After receiving his PhD in Anthropology from Yale University in 2007, Joseph Hill taught at Yale University, the University of Rochester, and the American University in Cairo. His ongoing, collaborative research project documents a transnational Sufi movement, the Tijaniyya Ibrahimiyya, in West Africa, looking at its urbanisation, globalisation, and integration into contrasting political and cultural contexts. His fieldwork has concentrated on Senegal and Mauritania, with additional research among West African Muslims in New York and Cairo. The leitmotif underlying his academic writing is the question of how multiple claims of truth and authority are accommodated and contested through discourses of &#8220;visible&#8221; and &#8220;hidden&#8221; truths. He has explored this theme in articles on language, gender, cosmopolitanism, sovereignty, and globalisation. Currently, he is writing a book on women who act as Sufi leaders where religious authority is strongly associated with men. He shows how women both utilise and undermine prevalent gender roles to support their leadership. Although women&#8217;s authority and influence are largely hidden due to the expectation that pious women must not seek visibility, women&#8217;s leadership decisively impacts the spread and governance of Sufi groups.</p>

<p><b><a name="zulfikar"></a>Zulfikar Hirji</b></p>
<p>Zulfikar Hirji (DPhil, Oxford) is Associate Professor at York University in the Department of Social and Cultural Anthropology. As an anthropologist and social historian, he is interested in how human societies articulate, represent and perform understandings of self, community and other in contemporary and historical contexts. His research focuses on Muslim societies in a range of historical and contemporary contexts. He is particularly concerned with the diverse ways in which Muslims express and articulate issues of deep human concern as well as matters of daily life. He also interrogates knowledge produced about Muslims, by academics and others. His research interests have lead him to study a range of issues including the production and performance of identity, the role of cultural workers and social movements, the dynamics of family networks and inter-generational migration, the socio-legal formation of communal identity in colonial contexts, and form and context of urban violence in religiously plural societies. He has conducted archival research and ethnographic fieldwork in various parts of the world including East Africa, South Asia, the Arabian Peninsula, Europe and North America. He is co-author and co-editor (with F. Daftary) of the <i>Ismailis, An Illustrated History</i> (IB Tauris &amp; IIS, 2008), and editor of <i>Diversity and Pluralism in Muslim Contexts</i> (IB Tauris &amp; IIS, 2010). He is currently co-editor of the Routledge Indian Ocean Series. In 2011, he has been an academic consultant for the Textile Museum of Canada exhibition and program on <i>Magic Squares: The Patterned Imagination of Muslim Africa in Contemporary Culture</i>, and has completed his first film, &#8216;Pushpanjali: A sensory invocation&#8217;, which is part of an ethnographic research project on the life-world of Tehreema Mitha, a Pakistan born, USA based, dancer-choreographer. Other current research projects include a critical biography of Sheikh-Sir Mbarak al-Hinawy (1896-1959), the second <i>liwali</i> of the British coastal protectorate at Mombasa. </p>

A specialist in Islamic art, the urban histories of pre-modern Muslim societies, and the interface between art and law in Muslim contexts, she has held the posts of Dean and Research Fellow at the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, Research Fellow at Oxford University and Visiting Fellow at the Aga Khan Programme for Art and Architecture at Harvard University. Professor Kana&#8217;an has undertaken a number of academic research projects including a study of institutions of architectural patronage in Ottoman Palestine including the <i>waqf</i>, and the manner in which pre-modern Muslim societies created civic space. This research formed the basis of two articles published in the journals <em>Levant</em> (2001) and <em>Muqarnas</em> (2001). Her research has also taken her to Oman where she carried out a comprehensive survey of Oman&#8217;s historical mosques focussing on their socio-legal development and artistic influences. An important aspect of this survey concerning the uniquely decorated <em>mihrabs</em> of <em>Ibadhi</em> mosques is published in <em>Islamic Art in Oman</em> (2008). Most recently, her interest in the confluence between art and law in Muslim contexts has lead to the re-assessment of the relationship between artist and patron in medieval Muslim societies. Her first article on this topic, &#8220;The <i>de jure</i> &#8216;Artist&#8217; of the Bobrinski Bucket: production and patronage in pre-Mongol Khurasan and Transoxiana&#8221;, was published in <i>Islamic Law and Society</i> (2009), and the second will appear in <i>Ars Orientalis</i> in 2012.

<p><b><a name="selma"></a>Selma Zecevic</b></p>
<p>Selma Zecevic (PhD, Columbia University) is Assistant Professor in the Department of Humanities at York University. Her research focuses on the strategies of legal interpretation in the Ottoman Empire, and most notably the construction and negotiation of gender in Ottoman Bosnian legal texts (<i>fatwa</i>s and manuals) and endowment documents (<i>waqf name</i>s). Her work is highly interdisciplinary, relying on polyglot sources (Arabic, Turkish, Persian, Italian) and different genres of writings. Her recent work examines the ways in which Catholic Ragusans - women and men - used Ottoman-Islamic legal institutions in order to renegotatie their legal rights as subjects of Ottoman Sultans and citizens of the semi-independent Catholic Republic of Ragusa (Dubrovnik). Her research, teaching and discussion of women and gender in Muslim societies includes the publication of &#8220;Missing Husbands, Waiting Wives, Bosnian Muftis: Fatwa Texts and the Interpretation of Gendered Presences and Absences in Late Ottoman Bosnia&#8221; in <i>Women in the Ottoman Balkans</i> (2007), and the facilitation of a session at Canadian Council of Muslim Women&#8217;s symposium.</p>
