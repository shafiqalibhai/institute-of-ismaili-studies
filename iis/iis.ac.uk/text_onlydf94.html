Little in&shy;formation is available on the early life of Hasan Sabbah, who was referred to as <I>Sayyidna</I> (our master) by his contemporary Nizari lsmailis. The colourful story, accord&shy;ing to which Hasan, Nizam al-Mulk, and &#8216;Umar Khayyam had made a pact when they were classmates in their youth under the same master at Nishapur, should be dis&shy;missed as a legend (see Rashid al-Din, pp. 110-12; Kashani, pp. 146-48; Mirkhand [Tehran], IV. pp. 199-204; Bowen, 1931, pp. 771-82). The events of Hasan&#8217;s career as the first ruler of Alamut are better documented; these events were recorded in the <I>Sargudhasht-i </I><I>sayyidna</I>, the first part of which may have been autobiographical. Although this chronicle, which marked the initiation of a Nizari tradition of historiography in Persia during the Alamut period, has not survived, it was used extensively by Juwayni, Rashid al-Din and Abu&#8217;l-Qasim Kashani, who are the chief authorities on Hasan&#8217;s life and career (see Daftary, 1992, pp. 91-97).<I></I></P>
<P>Hasan Sabbah was born in Qum into a <A href="text_only14df.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D59%27%29%29">Twelver Shi&#8216;i</A> family. His father, &#8216;Ali b. Muhammad b. Ja&#8216;far al-Sabbah al-Himyari, a Kufan claiming Himyari Yemeni ori&shy;gins, had migrated from Kufa to Qum. Subsequently, the Sabbah family settled down in Ray, where the youthful Hasan received his early religious education (in the Twelver Shi&#8216;i tradition). It was at Ray, a center of Isma&#8216;ili activities since the middle of the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> AH/9<SUP>th</SUP> CE century, that Hasan was introduced to their teachings by Amira Zarrab, a local Isma&#8216;ili <I>da&#8216;i. </I>Later, Hasan learnt more about Isma&#8216;ili doctrines from Abu Nasr Sarraj and other <I>da&#8216;i</I>s<I> </I>in Ray, and consequently, after having just turned seventeen, Hasan converted to Isma&#8216;ilism and took the oath of allegiance (<I>&#8216;<A href="text_only6b71.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D342%27%29%29">ahd</A></I>)<I> </I>to the Isma&#8216;ili <I><A href="text_only7eca.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D228%27%29%29">imam</A></I> of the time, the Fatimid Caliph al-Mustansir (427-87 AH/1036-94 CE).</P>
<P>In Ramadan 464 AH /May-June 1072 CE, the newly initiated Hasan managed to impress &#8216;Abd al-Malik b. &#8216;Attash, the chief Isma&#8216;ili <I>da&#8216;i </I>in the Saljuq territories, to such an ex&shy;tent that he appointed him to a position in the <I><A href="text_only627b.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D286%27%29%29">da&#8216;wa</A> </I>(mission) organisation. In 467 AH/1074-75 CE, Hasan accom&shy;panied Ibn &#8216;Attash to Isfahan, the secret headquarters of the Isma&#8216;ili <I>da&#8216;wa </I>in Persia, where he stayed until 469 AH /1076-77 CE, when, on instructions from Ibn &#8216;Attash, he left for Cairo to further his Isma&#8216;ili education. Hasan reached Egypt in Safar 471 AH/August 1078 CE and spent three years there, first in Cairo and then in Alexandria, before return&shy;ing to Isfahan. Almost nothing is known about Hasan&#8217;s experiences in Egypt. According to the lost Nizari chron&shy;icles used by Persian historians, while in Egypt he clashed with the Fatimid vizier Badr al-Jamali, who at that time had just succeeded al-Mu&#8217;ayyad fi&#8217;l-Din al-Shi&shy;razi as the chief <I>da&#8216;i (da&#8216;i al-du&#8216;at)</I>.<I> </I>Whether or not this conflict revolved around Hasan&#8217;s support for Nizar, Imam al&shy;-Mustansir&#8217;s heir-designate, who was eventually deprived of succession to the Fatimid caliphate by Badr al-Jamali&#8217;s own son and successor al-Afdal, Hasan was eventually banished from Egypt on Badr&#8217;s instructions. He returned to Isfahan in Dhu&#8217;l-hijja 473 AH /June 1081 CE.</P>
<P>Hasan&#8217;s subsequent travels over several years in the service of the <I>da&#8216;wa </I>and to evaluate the military strength of the Saljuqs were limited to different localities in Per&shy;sia. It was during this period that he formulated his own revolutionary strategy against the Saljuqs. By around 480 AH/1087 CE, Hasan was concentrating his efforts on the re&shy;gion of Daylam, which was a stronghold of Shi&#8216;ism, re&shy;mote from the centers of Saljuq control. He targeted for his headquarters the fortress of Alamut, located in the central Elburz Mountains of the Rudbar region. Hasan, who soon became the <I>da&#8216;i </I>of Daylam, reinvigorated the <I>da&#8216;wa </I>activities in northern Persia and finally seized Alamut in 483 AH/1090 CE by a clever plan of infiltration. This marked the foundation of what was to become the Nizari Isma&#8216;ili state of Persia. Hasan made the fortress impreg&shy;nable, and improved the cultivation and irrigation systems of the Alamut valley to make it self-sufficient in food production. Similar policies were later implemented in connection with other major Isma&#8216;ili strong&shy;holds. Hasan also established an important library at Alamut, whose collections of manuscripts and scientific instruments had grown to impressive proportions by the time the Mongols destroyed the fortress in 654 AH/1256 CE.</P>
<P>Hasan Sabbah seems to have had a complex set of religio-political motives for his revolt against the Sal&shy;juqs. As Shi&#8216;i Isma&#8216;ili, he could not have tolerated the ardently Sunni Saljuq Turks&#8217; hostility towards Shi&#8216;ism and their aim to uproot the Fatimid caliphate. Hasan&#8217;s revolt was perhaps also an expression of the Persians&#8217; resent&shy;ment over the alien rule of the Saljuq Turks, since they accounted for a large proportion of the early popular support he received. It was also as an assertion of his ethnic identity that, Hasan took the unprecedented step of replacing Arabic with Persian as the religious language of the Isma&#8216;ilis of Persia.</P>
<P>After firmly establishing himself at Alamut, Hasan extended his influence in the region by winning more converts, taking over more strongholds in Rudbar, and building new fortresses wherever he found a suitable lo&shy;cation. Alamut was soon raided by the forces of the near&shy;est Saljuq <I>amir</I>, marking the initiation of an endless series of Saljuq-Isma&#8216;ili military clashes. In 484 AH/1091 CE, Hasan sent the <I>da&#8216;i </I>Husayn Qa&#8217;ini to his native land of Quhistan&nbsp;in southeastern Khurasan to mobilise support there. The early success of the Isma&#8216;ilis of Quhistan soon erupted into a popular uprising seeking independence from the oppressive Saljuqs. The Isma&#8216;ilis thus seized control of several towns in Quhistan, which became another re&shy;gion, along with Rudbar, for their activities. In this way, in less than two years after the capture of Alamut, Hasan Sabbah had founded an independent territorial state for the Persian Isma&#8216;ilis in the midst of the Saljuq sultanate.</P>
<P>In 485 AH/1092 CE, major Saljuq expeditions were dispatched against the Isma&#8216;ilis in both Rudbar and Quhistan, but these operations came to a halt later in the same year on the assassination of the all-powerful Saljuq vizier Nizam al-Mulk, followed by Sultan Malikshah&#8217;s death a few weeks later. Taking advantage of the prolonged dis&shy;order and the rivalries in the Saljuq camp after Malek&shy;shah&#8217;s demise, Hasan consolidated and extended his power in Rudbar, where he seized the strategically lo&shy;cated fortress of Lamasar (Lanbasar) to the west of Alamut. The Persian Isma&#8216;ilis now also captured a number of strongholds, including Girdkuh near Damgan, as well as in Arrajan, the border region between Kuzistan and Fars.</P>
<P>By this time, the revolt of the Persian Isma&#8216;ilis against the Saljuqs had already acquired its distinctive pattern and methods of struggle designed by Hasan himself in view of the decentralised nature of political and military power in the Saljuq sultanate. Hasan&#8217;s plan was to uproot the Turks one by one from their separate strongholds by sending instructions from Alamut to his followers in each locality. He is famed for his decision to use assassination as an effective technique of struggle against the decentralised Saljuq opposition with its vastly superior military strength. This policy soon became identified with the Nizari Isma&#8216;ilis in an exaggerated manner, even though it had been adopted by many before them as well as their contemporaries. The actual Nizari assassinations of their prominent enemies were carried out by targeting key leaders and were never aimed at civilian populations. Invariably, they were countered by massacres of Isma&#8216;ilis by the Saljuqs.</P>
<P>The dispute over the succession to the Fatimid Imam-caliph al-Mustansir, who died in 487 AH/1094 CE, led to a per&shy;manent schism, splitting the Isma&#8216;ilis into rival Nizari and Musta&#8216;li factions. Hasan Sabbah, who was by then the undisputed leader of the Persian Isma&#8216;ilis and had already adopted an independent policy, supported the cause of Imam Nizar, Imam-caliph al-Mustansir&#8217;s eldest son and designated successor, who had nonetheless been denied the Fatimid caliphate. Recognizing Imam Nizar as his father&#8217;s successor to the Isma&#8216;ili <I>imamat</I>, Hasan now severed his ties with the Fatimid regime and the Isma&#8216;ili <I>da&#8216;wa </I>headquarters in Cairo, which had transferred their own allegiance to Imam Nizar&#8217;s younger brother, appointing him to the Fatimid caliphate with the title of al-Musta&#8216;li bi&#8217;llah. Hasan Sabbah had now in effect founded an independent Nizari Isma&#8216;ili <I>da&#8216;wa, </I>and his decision to support Imam Nizar&#8217;s cause was en&shy;dorsed by all the Isma&#8216;ilis of Persia and Iraq, who came to be known as the Nizariya.</P>
<P>From the early years of the 6<SUP>th</SUP> AH/12<SUP>th</SUP> CE century, Hasan be&shy;gan to send <I>da&#8216;i</I>s<I> </I>from Alamut to Syria, an early Isma&#8216;ili centre of activity, to propagate the Nizari <I>da&#8216;wa. </I>As a result of the activities of these <I>da&#8216;i</I>s,<I> </I>an expanding Nizari community soon emerged in Syria which eventually became the sole representation of Isma&#8216;ilis there. However, almost half a century of continu&shy;ous efforts were needed before the Nizaris could gain possession of a group of permanent strongholds in cen&shy;tral Syria, which was affiliated to the Nizari state in Persia.</P>
<P>After Imam Nizar was killed in Cairo in 488 AH/1095 CE, the Nizari Isma&#8216;ilis were left without an accessible <I>imam</I>. Indeed, Imam Nizar&#8217;s own name and caliphal title (<I>al-Mustafa </I><I>li-&shy;Din Allah</I>)<I> </I>continued to be mentioned for almost seventy years after his death on coins struck at Alamut (see Miles, 1972, pp. 155-62). In the absence of a manifest <I>imam</I>, Hasan himself served as the head of the Nizari <I>da&#8216;wa </I>and state, with the rank of <I><A href="text_only0cc6.html?s=javascript%3Avoid%28LaunchGlossary%28%27ContentLink.asp%3Ftype%3Dglossary%26amp%3Bid%3D243%27%29%29">hujja</A> </I>(chief representa&shy;tive of the hidden <I>imam</I>). The Nizari <I>imam</I> assumed authority four decades after Hasan&#8217;s own death (see Ivanow, 1933 [<I>Haft bab-i Baba Sayyidna</I>],<I> </I>p<I>. </I>21; Tusi, 1950, text p. 148, tr. p. 173; Quhistani, 1959, text pp. 23, 43).</P>
<P>Outsiders from early on gained the impression that the movement of the Persian Isma&#8216;ilis led by Hasan Sabbah represented a new teaching, and it became designated as the &#8216;new preaching&#8217; (<I>al-da&#8216;wa al jadida</I>)<I> </I>in contradis&shy;tinction to the &#8216;old preaching&#8217; (<I>al-da&#8216;wa al-qadima</I>)<I> </I>of the Fatimid Isma&#8216;ilis. However, the &#8216;new preaching&#8217; was no more than the reformulation of the established Shi&#8216;i doctrine of <I>ta&#8216;lim </I>(authoritative instruction). This doc&shy;trine was restated more vigorously by Hasan in a Persian treatise entitled <I>Chahar fasl</I>,<I> </I>&#8216;The Four Chapters&#8217; (Ara&shy;bic: <I>al-Fusul al-arba&#8216;a</I>)<I> </I>which, although not extant, has been preserved fragmentarily by, amongst others, his contemporary Abu&#8217;l-Fath Shahrastani (d. 548/1153), who may have had Isma&#8216;ili leanings (see Shahrastani, 1968. II, pp. 195-98; <I>idem</I>, 1984, pp. 165, 167-70; Juwayni, 1912-37, III, pp. 195-99; <I>idem</I>. 1958, II, pp. 671-73; Rashid al-Din, pp. 105-7; Kashani, pp. 142-43). In a series of four propositions, Hasan argued for the inadequacy of human reason in knowing God and for the necessity of an authoritative teacher <I>(mu&#8216;allim-i sadiq) </I>as the spiri&shy;tual guide of men, who would be none other than the Isma&#8216;ili <I>imam</I> of the time. Henceforth, the Persian Nizaris became known also as the <I>Ta&#8216;limiya</I>. The anti&shy;-Isma&#8216;ili polemics of the contemporary Sunni establish&shy;ment, led by Muhammad Ghazali and endorsed by Nizam al-Mulk, were focused directly against this doc&shy;trine of <I>ta&#8216;lim</I>,<I> </I>which served as the central teaching of the Nizari Isma&#8216;ilis.</P>
<P>The fortunes of the Persian Isma&#8216;ilis continued to rise in Barkyaruq&#8217;s reign (487-98 AH/1094-1105 CE), when they achieved new gains closer to the seat of Saljuq power in Isfahan, seizing the fortress of Shahdiz, also known as Dizkuh. Having grown weary of the general threat of the Isma&#8216;ilis to Saljuq rule, Barkyaruq and Sanjar now agreed to check, in their respective territories, the rising power of the Isma&#8216;ilis. This strategy was more effec&shy;tively pursued, however, by Muhammad Tapar (498-511 AH/1105-18 CE) who, in 503 AH/1109 CE, initiated a major and pro&shy;longed campaign against Alamut itself. Hasan&#8217;s defense of Alamut during this period was a blow to the Saljuqs, who failed to take the fortress by assault or attrition despite their superior military power. By the time of Muham&shy;mad Tapar&#8217;s death, Saljuq-Isma&#8216;ili relations had entered a new phase of stalemate, with the Persian Isma&#8216;ilis successfully defending important territories, including mountain strongholds, villages and towns in Rudbar, Quhistan and Kumesh (Arabic: Qumis). Although Hasan Sabbah<I> </I>had failed to overcome the Saljuqs, he did succeed in founding both a state and the independent Nizari Isma&#8216;ili <I>da&#8216;wa</I>,<I> </I>which survived the downfall of the Nizari state.</P>
<P>An organiser and a political strategist of the highest calibre, Hasan Sabbah was at the same time a trained<I> </I>theologian. He led an austere life and is said to have ob&shy;served the <I>shari&#8216;a </I>very strictly himself as well as impos&shy;ing it on his Nizari community; equally strict with friend and foe, he had both his sons executed, one for alleged murder, the other on suspicion of drinking wine. He is also said to have sent his wife and daughters away per&shy;manently to Girdkuh, where they earned a living by spinning. The Persian historians relate that dur&shy;ing all the thirty-four years that Hasan lived at Alamut, he never descended from the castle. Rashid al-Din (pp. 133-&shy;34) reports that he spent most of his time inside his per&shy;sonal quarters reading books, committing the teachings of the <I>da&#8216;wa </I>to writing and administering the affairs of his realm.</P>
<P>When he sensed that he was reaching the end of his life, Hasan summoned Kia Buzurg-Umid, his capable lieutenant at Lamasar, and designated him as his suc&shy;cessor in Alamut. He died, after a brief illness, on 26 Rabi&#8216; II 518 AH/12 June 1124 CE (or possibly twenty days ear&shy;lier), and was buried near Alamut. Hasan Sabbah&#8217;s mau&shy;soleum was regularly visited by the Nizari Isma&#8216;ilis until it was demolished by the Mongols in 654 AH/1256 CE.</P>
